# This script is intended for a default stand-alone
# start-up of Tycho in non-graphical mode. Arguments
# to the command line are passed to the ::tycho::start
# procedure (see the file tycho), with the -nogui flag
# set on. Note that this script should NOT be executed
# if you are using Ptolemy with Tycho -- use the tycho
# script supplied with the Ptolemy distribution.


# Find the Tycho directory. The search looks in
# for the environment variables TYCHO and TYCHO_LIBRARY.
# If neither of those is found, it sees if the current
# directory has a pkgIndex.tcl file, in which case it uses
# that. If it finds a candidate directory, it checks to
# see if the directory is in auto_path, and if not, appends
# it. If it doesn't find a candidate directory, it complains.
