<H2>New work in Ptolemy 0.7.1</H2>
<DL>
<DT> Further integrations of <A HREF="../../../tycho/doc/index.html">Tycho</A>
into Ptolemy. -
Edward A. Lee, John Reekie, Cliff Cordiero, Kevin Chang, Christopher Hylands and many others.
 <dd>
The <A HREF="../../../tycho/doc/releasenotes0.2.1.html">Tycho Release</A>
notes describe the changes to Tycho more completely, below are some
highlights:
<MENU>
	<li> New package system - John Reekie, Christopher Hylands
	<li> Emacs-style search and file open - Cliff Cordeiro
	<li> HTTP, FTP, and mailto support - Kevin Chang, John Reekie
	<li> New documentation viewer (idoc) - Cliff Cordeiro
</MENU>
 
<DT> The Adaptive Computing Systems (ACS) Domain -
James Lundblad
<DD> The ACS domain uses different styles of stars than the rest of
Ptolemy.  ACS splits a star into a single interface (called a Corona),
and one or more implementations, called Cores.
 <br> See the <A HREF="../../../src/domains/acs/doc/index.html">ACS Documentation</A> for more information.

<DT> Mutable Universe Changes for DE -
Jens Voigt, John Davis, II
 <p>For a complete description,
 see <a href="mutablede.html">Dynamic Higher Order Functions for DE</a>
<DD> There are two demos:
<menu>
<li> <a href="../../../src/domains/de/contrib/demo/DynBlockIntTest">NonGraphical Demonstration of Dynamic Map Function</a>
<li> <a href="../../../src/domains/de/contrib/demo/DynBlockGrTest">Graphical Demonstration of Dynamic Map Function</a>
</menu>

<dt> HOF fixes - Tom Lane
<menu>
<li> HOF stars now manipulate aliases correctly: in particular, when creating
new connections into or out of a galaxy, individual alias portholes are
created along with the new real portholes at the endpoint stars.  This
eliminates many pecularities that formerly occurred with HOF stars just
inside or just outside a galaxy boundary.  For example, a HOFNop just
inside a galaxy boundary can now expand the galaxy's multiport to the
right number of connections without help from a bus icon outside.
<li> Delays on connections to HOF stars are also much better-behaved than
before.
<li> Reorganized HOFBase and HOFBaseHiOrdFn to make the difference in
functionality more clear: HOFBase supports basic porthole-reconnection,
HOFBaseHiOrdFn supports instantiation of replacement blocks.
</menu>

<dt> Ptolemy interfaces to Matlab and Mathematica -
Brian Evans, Guy Maor,  and Wade Schwartzkopf


<dd>      <UL>
     <LI> upgrade to work with Matlab 5 and Mathematica 3 by default but
          allow it to be recompiled with Matlab 4 and Mathematica 2.2
     <LI> dynamically link the interface to Matlab
     <LI> remove dependence of the PTcl class on the interfaces to
	  Matlab and Mathematica Tcl commands, and instead, have the
	  Matlab and Mathematica Tcl commands be registered.
     </UL>
	We cannot ship binaries built with the current Matlab 5 interface,
	since they will not work on machines that do not have Matlab installed.

<dt> Java version of <CODE>pxgraph</CODE>, 
<a href="../../../tycho/java/ptplot/index.html">Ptplot</a> -
Edward A. Lee, Christopher Hylands, Bicheng William Wu

<dd> Note that the X11 sources for <CODE>pxgraph </CODE> are also
included, see
<a href="../../../src/pxgraph/README.txt"><CODE>$PTOLEMY/src/pxgraph/README.txt</CODE></a> 


<dt> C50 domain changes: Professor Brian Evans and his students
 <dd>
 <p>  The C50 stars no longer generate assembly code with assembly
  directives so that different targets that support different
  assembly directives can be used.  The new stars work for
  both the C50 DSK target and the new SimC50Target.

 <p>  The new SimC50Target invokes the standard (commercial) C50
  simulator written by Texas Instruments.  TI will generally
  donate this simulator to universities.  This new target
  sets the stage for a C50 Evaluation Module Board target.


<dt> Synchronous Reactive C Code Generation Domain -
Frederic Boulanger, SupÅÈlec 
<dd> See the
<a href="../../../src/domains/srcgc/demo/init.pal">SRCGC Demos</a> and
<a href="../../../src/domains/srcgc/icons/srcgc.pal">SRCGC Stars</a> palettes.

<dt> Support for the <A HREF="http://www.cygnus.com/egcs/">EGCS</A> C++
Compiler -
Christopher Hylands
<dd> See <a href="../../../doc/html/release.html#egcs"><CODE>$PTOLEMY/doc/html/release.html</CODE></a> for more information.

<dt> Preliminary port to Windows NT -
Christopher Hylands
<dd> Ptolemy 0.7.1 runs under Windows NT using the
Cygwin32 compiler and the Cygwin32 X11R6 binaries.  To run
<CODE>pigi</CODE> under NT, you will need a NT X server.
For more information, see the
<a href="../../../doc/html/nt/index.html">Ptolemy under Windows NT</a>
page.
