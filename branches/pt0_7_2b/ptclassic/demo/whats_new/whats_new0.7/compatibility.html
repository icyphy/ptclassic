<H3>Backward Compatibility Issues in Ptolemy 0.7</H3>

<DL>

<DT> Recompilation will be necessary.
<DD> As always, if you upgrade from 0.6 to 0.7, you will need to recompile
	any user designed stars.

<DT> Type system changes
<DD> The type system has been changed.  Some Code Generation universes may
	need explicit conversion stars to properly compile.
	<A HREF="typesys.html">Further Documentation</A>

<DT> <CODE>htmldoc</CODE> is a new keyword that has been added to
<CODE>ptlang</CODE>.
<DD> <CODE>ptlang</CODE> no longer generates troff output and instead
	generates html.  The html output is generated in the
	<CODE>stars/</CODE> directory.  In releases earlier than
	Ptolemy0.7, the troff output was generated in
	 <CODE>stars/../doc/stars</CODE>

<DT> Certain HOF stars have been removed
<DD> Revisions in the HOF domain make the following star types no longer
	necessary:
	<UL>
	<LI> <CODE>HOFDelayedMap</CODE> is replaced by <CODE>HOFMap</CODE>.
	
	<LI> <CODE>HOFSrc</CODE><I>xxx</I> and
	<CODE>HOFSrcGr</CODE><I>xxx</I> (where <I>xxx</I> is a type,
	such as <CODE>Int</CODE>).  All these variants are replaced by
	the generic <CODE>HOFSrc</CODE> and <CODE>HOFSrcGr</CODE>.
	
	</UL>
	
	If you have universes that were using the old stars, you will
	need to use <CODE>masters</CODE> or <CODE>ptfixtree</CODE> to
	update their references.

<DT> Certain CGC DSP stars have been moved.
<DD> To support retargeting demonstrations and galaxies from SDF to CGC, 
	Brian Evans moved the CGC stars that implemented DSP functions from
	the <CODE>cgc/stars</CODE> directory to the <CODE>cgc/dsp/stars</CODE>
	directory and
	set symbolic links from <CODE>cgc/icons</CODE>
	to <CODE>cgc/dsp/icons</CODE>
	for
	those stars for backwards compatibility.
	Users should run masters on their own CGC demos in order
	for look-inside to work.
	 <BR>Affected stars: 
	<CODE>DTMFPostTest</CODE>,
	<CODE>Dirichlet</CODE>, <CODE>FFTCx</CODE>, <CODE>FIR</CODE>,
	<CODE>FIRFix</CODE>, <CODE>GAL</CODE>, <CODE>GGAL</CODE>,
	<CODE>Goertzel</CODE>, <CODE>GoertzelBase</CODE>,
	<CODE>GoertzelPower</CODE>, <CODE>IIR</CODE>, <CODE>LMS</CODE>,
	<CODE>LMSOscDet</CODE>, <CODE>RaisedCosine</CODE>, 
	<CODE>Sinc</CODE>, <CODE>Window</CODE>.


<DT> CGC stars that have been removed
<DD> <CODE>CGCPCM</CODE>, <CODE>CGCPCMread</CODE>, <CODE>CGCPCMwrite</CODE>,
	<CODE>CGCSunSound</CODE>, <CODE>CGCTkSunSound</CODE>
	Also, <CODE>SDFReadPCM</CODE> was removed and replaced with
	<CODE>SDFPCMReadInt</CODE>

<DT> The <CODE>cgc/targets/main</CODE> directory has been split.
<DD> To separate the uniprocessor and multiprocessor CGC targets,
	Brian Evans split the CGC <CODE>targets/main</CODE>
	directory into <CODE>targets/uniproc</CODE>
	and <CODE>targets/multiproc</CODE>

<DT> CG56 stars that have been removed
<DD> <CODE>CG56Cut</CODE>, <CODE>CG56Pad</CODE>

<DT> Structure of directories under <CODE>PTOLEMY_SYSTEMS</CODE>
	has been changed.
<DD> To support portability between operating systems, Brian Evans changed the
	destination directory in the Ptolemy targets and demonstrations to
	<code>$HOME/PTOLEMY_SYSTEMS/<em>domain</em></code>.
	For mixed-domain demos, the <em>domain</em> was set to MIXED;
	otherwise, the <em>domain</em> was set to SDF, CGC, etc.
	Note that <code>$HOME</code> is used instead of <code>~</code>
	because POSIX-compliant Unix operating systems always define
	the HOME environment variable but do not always support ~.
	Also, it is possible to define environment variables on Macs and PCs.

<DT> Certain audio stars have been removed.
<DD> Sunil Bhave removed the old PCMread/write and 
	SunSound stars from ptdesign. Instead you can use the new
	MonoIn/Out stars, which have been added to the cgc palettes.
	The TkSunSound star is also gone.
        In Ptolemy 0.7, the mu law conversion tables are in the 
	<CODE>libptdsp</CODE> library.  If you use


<DT> <CODE>SDFIntDiv</CODE> and <CODE>SDFModulus</CODE> have been renamed
<DD> <CODE>SDFIntDiv</CODE> and <CODE>SDFModulus</CODE> were in
<CODE>src/domains/sdf/contrib/stars</CODE>.  These stars have been moved
to <CODE>src/domains/sdf/stars</CODE> and renamed to 
<CODE>SDFDivByInt</CODE> and <CODE>SDFModuloInt</CODE>.

<DT> <CODE>BDFTrue</CODE> renamed to <CODE>BDFCondGate</CODE>
<DD> Brian Evans renamed the <CODE>BDFTrue</CODE> star to
	<CODE>BDFCondGate</CODE>.

<DT> Float-to-int particle conversion now works as documented

<DD> The Almagest said that float-to-int particle conversion rounded floats
	to the nearest int.  In fact, the code was using the
	<CODE>int()</CODE> cast operator, which truncates toward 0 for
	positive values, and truncates in a machine dependent way for
	negative values.
	
	<br>Now, floats are rounded to the nearest integer as
	specified, both in implicit particle conversions and in
	FloatToInt stars.
	
	<br>This may break a few existing schematics that depend on
	the old behavior.
	For example, we noticed that the DE basic switch demo was
	failing with a message like:
	<PRE>
Error: switch.Case.output=21: The control value 2 is not in the range [0,1] 
	</PRE>
	
	The demo had been generating fractional values in the range 0
	to 1.9, which were truncated to the 0 or 1 expected by the
	Case star.  With rounding, the last few values converted to 2
	instead.  We changed the demo to generate fractional values
	running from 0 to 1, which round to the required control
	values.

<DT> <CODE>DERepeatStar</CODE> improvements
	
<DD>DERepeatStar has been revised to use a delay marker rather than
	setting nonstandard porthole priorities on its feedback arc.
	In most cases this will give better behavior for derived stars
	that have regular input ports in addition to the feedback arc.
	Derived stars that set delayType or contain triggers()
	directives may need to be revised.  Also, DERepeatStar can now
	pass a numeric value in each feedback event.  See section
	11.2.6 of the Programmer's Manual for details.
