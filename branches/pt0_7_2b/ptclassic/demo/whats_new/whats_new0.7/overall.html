<H1>The SR Domain</H1>

<H2>Introduction</H2>

The Synchronous/Reactive domain implements a model of computation
based on a the synchronous model of time like that in the Esterel
language <A HREF="#SED:berry:92a">[1]</A>.  It is well-suited for
specifying discrete reactive controllers--systems that maintain an
ongoing dialog with their environment and must react to it at a speed
dictated by the environment.

<P>

The model of time in the SR domain is based on the concept of an
infinitely-fast machine.  When an input arrives from the outside
world, the infinitely fast machine computes and produces its reaction
<EM>at the same instant the input arrives</EM>.  Time is thus a series
of discrete instants when the machine is performing a computation.
Between these instants, nothing happens.

<P>

The stars in the SR domain communicate through unbuffered single
driver, multiple receiver arcs.  These arcs carry valued events, which
may be present with a value, absent, or unknown in each instant.  The
value on an arc does not persist between instants.

<P>

The SR domain domain simulates the execution of an infinitely-fast
machine an instant at a time.  The behavior of the system in each
instant is simulated in two phases.  In the first phase, the stars in
the system are fired repeatedly (their <TT>go()</TT> methods are
called) to reach a fixed-point on the arcs' values.  The stars in the
SR domain satisfy a monotonicity constraint that ensures this fixed
point always exists and is unique, regardless of firing order.  In the
second phase, all stars are instructed (their <TT>tick()</TT> method
is called) to advance their state, if any, based on the values of
their input arcs.  This prepares them for the next instant.

<P>

Broadly, there are two types of stars in the SR domain: strict and
non-strict.  If any input to a strict star is unknown, then all of its
outputs are unknown.  A two-input adder, for example, behaves like
this--it cannot say anything about its output until the values of both
inputs are known.  A non-strict star, by contrast, can produce some
outputs before all of its inputs are known.  A two-input multiplexer
is an example: when the selection input is known, it can ignore the
unselected input.

<P>

Non-strict stars are the key to avoiding deadlocked situations when
there are cyclic connections in the system.  If all the stars in a
cycle are strict, they each need all of their inputs before producing
an output--all will be left waiting.  The deadlock can be broken by
introducing a non-strict star into the cycle that can produce an
output without having all inputs from other stars in the cycle

<HR>

<H2>Writing SR Stars</H2>

A porthole on an SR star can have an unknown value, an absent value,
or be present with a particle.  These states can be tested with the
following methods, which can be called on both input and output
PortHoles:

<P>

<DL>
<DT> <TT>int SRPortHole::known()</TT>
<DD> Return <TT>TRUE</TT> when the value in the port is is known
<DT> <TT>int SRPortHole::present()</TT>
<DD> Return <TT>TRUE</TT> when the value in the port is present
<DT> <TT>int SRPortHole::absent()</TT>
<DD> Return <TT>TRUE</TT> when the value in the port is absent
</DL>

Once the presence of a particle on an input port is established, it
can be accessed as follows:

<P>

<DL>
<DT> <TT>Particle &amp; InSRPort::get()</TT>
<DD> Return the particle in the port.  This should only be called
	when <TT>present()</TT> returns <TT>TRUE</TT> 
</DL>

The value on an output port can be established by calling one of the
following.  In an instant, a star may invoke one of these methods
exactly once--more than this is an error.  (This ensures the
fixed-point computation in an instant always terminates.)

<P>

<DL>
<DT> <TT>Particle &amp; OutSRPort::emit()</TT>
<DD> Force the value on the output port to be present and
	return a reference to the output particle.
<DT> <TT>void OutSRPort::makeAbsent()</TT>
<DD> Force the value on the output port to be absent.
</DL>

A number of methods set attributes of SR stars.  These should be
called in the <TT>setup</TT> method of a star as appropriate.  By
default, none of these attributes is assumed to hold.

<P>

<DL>
<DT> <TT>SRStar::reactive()</TT>
<DD> Indicate the star is reactive--it needs at least one
	present input to produce a present output.
<DT> <TT>Star::noInternalState()</TT>
<DD> Indicate the star has no internal state--its behavior in
	an instant is a function only of the inputs in that instant,
	and not on history.
</DL>

By default, a star in the SR domain is strict.  Here is (abbreviated)
<TT>ptlang</TT> source for a two-input adder:

<LISTING>
defstar {
    name { Add }
    domain { SR }

    input {
        name { input1 }
        type { int }
    }

    input {
        name { input2 }
        type { int }
    }

    output {
        name { output }
        type { int }
    }

    setup {
        reactive();
        noInternalState();
    }

    go {
        if ( input1.present() && input2.present() ) {
            output.emit() << int(input1.get()) + int(input2.get());
        } else {
          Error::abortRun(*this, "One input present, the other absent");
        }
    }

}
</LISTING>

Non-strict stars inherit from the <TT>SRNonStrictStar</TT> class.
Here is abbreviated source for a non-strict two-input multiplexer:

<LISTING>
defstar {
    name { Mux }
    domain { SR }
    derivedFrom { SRNonStrictStar }

    input {
        name { trueInput }
        type { int }
    }

    input {
        name { falseInput }
        type { int }
    }

    input {
        name { select }
        type { int }
    }

    output {
        name { output }
        type { int }
    }

    setup {
        noInternalState();
        reactive();
    }

    go {
        if ( !output.known() && select.known() ) {
            if ( select.present() ) {
                if ( int(select.get()) ) {

                    // Select is true--copy the true input if it's known

                    if ( trueInput.known() ) {
                        if ( trueInput.present() ) {
                            output.emit() << int(trueInput.get());
                        } else {
                            // true input is absent: make the output absent
                            output.makeAbsent();
                        }
                    }
                } else {

                    // Select is false--copy the false input if it's known

                    if ( falseInput.known() ) {
                        if ( falseInput.present() ) {
                            output.emit() << int(trueInput.get());
                        } else {
                            // false input is absent: make the output absent
                            output.makeAbsent();
                        }
                    }

                }

            } else {

                // Select is absent: make the output absent

                output.makeAbsent();
            }
        }
    }
}
