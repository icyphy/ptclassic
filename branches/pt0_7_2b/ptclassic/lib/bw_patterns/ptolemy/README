This directory contains the definitions of patterns used by Vem
when running Ptolemy in black and white or when generating postscript
output.  To change these, edit the file patterns.pat.
Then run "installColors".

The file patterns.pat defines the patterns used by vem to display ptolemy
facets.  In Vem terminology, it defines the 'ptolemy technology.'
The patterns can be changed, and users can define their own patterns.

The patterns must be incorporated into the tap.views facet for any
changes to take effect.  This can be done as follows:

	cd ~ptolemy/lib/bw_patterns/ptolemy
	installColors

This invokes a program located in ~ptolemy/octtools/bin.sun4, where
'sun4' may be replaced with whatever machine type you are running on.
The dialog with the program should proceed as follows:
	Root directory for technology [~ptolemy/lib/colors]:
		< enter the directory if the default is not correct. E.g.>
		~ptolemy/lib/bw_patterns
	Color output device [yes]: no

The file patterns.pat is pretty self-explanatory.
Larger priorities 0,1,2,... indicate greater visibility priority.
Priorities may evidently be arbitrarily large.

If you wish to create your own patterns, you may create a directory
like this one somewhere.  Suppose you define your patterns in a directory
called "~myLogin/myPatterns".  Then
	mkdir ~myLogin/myPatterns
	cd ~myLogin/myPatterns
	cp -r ~ptolemy/lib/patterns/ptolemy .
	cd ptolemy
	vi patterns.pat
Edit patterns.pat, run installColors as explained above,
and set the X resources as follows:

vem.technology:  ~myLogin/myPatterns

Then restart pigi.
