This directory contains the definitions of colors used by Vem
when running Ptolemy.  To change these, edit the file colors.pat.
Then run "installColors".

The file colors.pat defines the colors used by vem to display ptolemy
facets.  In Vem terminology, it defines the 'ptolemy technology.'
The colors can be changed, and users can define their own colors.

The colors must be incorporated into the tap.views facet for any
changes to take effect.  This can be done as follows:

	cd ~ptolemy/lib/colors/ptolemy
	installColors

This invokes a program located in ~ptolemy/octtools/bin.sun4, where
'sun4' may be replaced with whatever machine type you are running on.
The dialog with the program should proceed as follows:
	Name of the color pattern file [colors.pat]:
	Root directory for technology [~ptolemy/lib/colors]:
		< enter the directory if the default is not correct >
	Color output device [yes]:

The file colors.pat is pretty self-explanatory.
Larger priorities 0,1,2,... indicate greater visibility priority.
Priorities may evidently be arbitrarily large.

If you wish to create your own colors, you may create a directory
like this one somewhere.  Suppose you define your colors in a directory
called "~myLogin/myColors".  Then
	mkdir ~myLogin/myColors
	cd ~myLogin/myColors
	cp -r ~ptolemy/lib/colors/ptolemy .
	cd ptolemy
	vi colors.pat
Edit colors.pat, run installColors as explained above,
and set the X resources as follows:

vem.technology:  ~myLogin/myColors

Then restart pigi.

Unfortunately, you have to jump through hoops to get the "P"
command to open your new palette, if you make a new palette.
The default palette is stored
in "~ptolemy/lib/colors/ptolemy/layers:schematic:contents".
This is accessed by Vem as "($OCTTOOLS)/tech/colors/layers:schematic:contents",
where OCTTOOLS is an environment variable normally set to "~ptolemy"
and "tech" is a symbolic link in ~ptolemy.  You have to change
set OCTTOOLS in your environment to point to some intermediate
directory, then in that directory, put a symbolic link to the directory
where you stored your technology.

Note: You can save a little disk space by creating symbolic links to
parts of the directory you do not wish to change.
For instance, the files of form myColors/ptolemy/%* may be OK
as they are.
