#
# Programs to use
#
RANLIB =	ranlib
CC =		gcc

# At A.C.R.I. RCS is used instead of SCCS
# command to use when getting files from source control (Gnu make)
#GET=co

# If we have g++, then compile Octtools with gcc.  ARCHs that are cfront
# based probably don't have gcc.
# OCT_CC is used in src/octtools/vem-{lib,bin}.mk
# On the mips with Ultrix4.3A, don't use -traditional, or you will get
# errors sys/types.h
OCT_CC =	gcc -fwritable-strings


# In config-$PTARCH.mk, we set the following variables.  We need to 
# use only the following variables so that we can use them elsewhere, say
# for non-optimized compiles.
# OPTIMIZER - The setting for the optimizer, usually -O2.
# MEMLOG    - Formerly used to log memory allocation and deallocation.
# WARNINGS  - Flags that print warnings.
# ARCHFLAGS - Architecture dependent flags, useful for determining which
#	      OS we are on.  Often of the form -DPTSOL2_4.
# LOCALCCFLAGS - Other architecture dependent flags that apply to all releases
#	      of the OS for this architecture for c++
# LOCALCFLAGS - Other architecture dependent flags that apply to all releases
#	      of the OS for this architecture for c++
# USERFLAGS - Ptolemy makefiles should never set this, but the user can set it.

OPTIMIZER =	-O2
# -pipe might not work under DEC Alpha 'as'
LOCALCCFLAGS =	-g -DPT_USE_RAND
WARNINGS =	-Wall -Wcast-qual
GPPFLAGS =	$(OPTIMIZER) $(MEMLOG) $(WARNINGS) \
			$(ARCHFLAGS) $(LOCALCCFLAGS) $(USERFLAGS)
LOCALCFLAGS =	$(LOCALCCFLAGS)
CFLAGS =	$(OPTIMIZER) $(MEMLOG) $(WARNINGS) \
			$(ARCHFLAGS) $(LOCALCFLAGS) $(USERFLAGS)

# system libraries for linking .o files from C files only
# -lots is needed to resolve _OtsDivide64Unsigned which is in the Matlab lib.
# To compile gcc, you may need to add -lots to CLIB in 
#  $PTOLEMY/src/gnu/src/gcc/config/alpha/x-alpha
CSYSLIBS = 	-lots -lm

# system libraries (libraries from the environment)
#SYSLIBS =	-lg++ $(CSYSLIBS)

#
# Variables for the linker
#
# The dynamically linked version of pigiRpc has problems that *may*
# stem from a symbol collision (clog) between libm and libg++.
#
# If we are building static binaries, then
# -depth_ring_search is necessary for incremental linking to work.
# Without -depth_ring_search, changes in a reloaded star will
# not be visible.  For more information about -depth_ring_search, see
# ld(1) and loader(5)
# To use dlopen() style linking, we cannot use build static binaries
LINKFLAGS =	-L$(LIBDIR)
LINKFLAGS_D =	-L$(LIBDIR)

# After building the binaries, strip them or you will get a 38Mb ptcl!
# On the DEC alpha, stripping ptcl did not break incremental linking.
# The ld man page would indicate that you should be able to pass -x
# to ld, however, with -x you may see the following error:
# /usr/lib/cmplrs/cc/crt0.o: writeat_outbuf: Position 0x0 not in
#     buffer pd_outbuf
STRIP_DEBUG = /usr/ccs/bin/strip
# To turn of stripping:
#STRIP_DEBUG = true

#
# Directories to use

#X11_INCSPEC =	-I$(ROOT)/src/compat

# For some silly reason, the X11 library has a function linked in
# which wants to see DECnet.  Fortunately, science has a cure.
