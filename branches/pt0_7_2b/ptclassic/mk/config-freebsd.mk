# Ptolemy 0.7 notes.  All first person presenatations are
# by dufault@hda.com

# If you're going to use ptolemy during the beta test use FreeBSD 2.2.1.
# This has the correct versions of the compiler,
# etc, and you won't have to install the "pgcc" port.  The 3.0 tree
# may work but of course is under test and active development.
# The older 2.1 branch will need at least the "pgcc" port of the new compiler.

# I used xv from the ports collection rather than build the one
# with Ptolemy.

# The basic process is to build the included itcl2.2 and add the shared
# libraries, build octtools, and then build ptolemy.  I provided a
# build script that worked for me.

# Note: You need a lot of swap to build Ptolemy.  I expect out of the
# box installations using the sysinstall default will not have enough.
# I have about 100MB and it just sneaks by.
# Use "vnconfig" to swap to a file if you don't have enough.

# Running edit-label may result in the following X server error
# when OK is pressed:
#  A Fatal Xt Toolkit Error has occurred:
#   Attempt to unmanage a child when parent is not Composite
#   Type 'y' to continue, 'n' to exit, 'a' to abort
#   (continuing may have unpredictable consequences):
#
# This message is known from Linux and XFree86 Version 3.1. It's
# probably a bug in the X-Release and has gone with the upgrade
# to XFree86 3.2.
