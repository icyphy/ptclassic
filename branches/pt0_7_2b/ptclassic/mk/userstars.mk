# This file is designed to be used by a user with custom stars
# that are to be dynamically linked. It is only required when
# the compilation options built into the dynamic linker are
# not adequate.  For example, not all include files are in the
# include paths that are specified by default.  The user should
# create a makefile in the same directory where the stars are
# defined.  This should be called "make.template".  I minimal
# version of this is as shown below (the stars are assumed to
# be in the DE domain, of course, you would need to remove the 
# leading comment symbols '#' first):
#
#--start--
# ROOT = $(PTOLEMY)
# VPATH = .
# include $(ROOT)/mk/config-$(PTARCH).mk
# INCL = -I$(ROOT)/src/domains/de/kernel -I$(KERNDIR)
# PL_SRCS = DEMyFirstStar.pl DEMySecondStar.pl
# DOMAIN = DE
# include $(ROOT)/mk/userstars.mk
#--end--
#	
# The above file assumes the PTOLEMY environment variable is set to point
# to the home directory of the Ptolemy installation (e.g. /users/ptolemy).
#
# It also assumes the PTARCH environment variable is set to specify the target
# architecture (such as "sun4").
#
# The VPATH variable specifies where the sources are.  If the directory name
# in which your stars are stored includes the string "/src/", then the
# object files will be put in a corresponding directory with "src" replaced
# by $(PTARCH).  This allows your stars to have several object files for
# different architectures simultaneously.
#
# The include statement includes a standard Ptolemy makefile for the
# specified architecture.  You may want to look at that makefile. 
#
# The INCL definition specifies one or more directories to be searched
# for include files.  You need at least the kernel directory for the domain
# you are using.  If your stars are derived from standard stars, you will
# also need the directory in which those standard stars are defined.
# Also, very few Ptolemy stars will get by without the ptolemy kernel
# directory, specified by -I$(KERNDIR).
#
# PL_SRCS is the list of .pl files that you want to generate .o files for
# If you are using GNU make, then you could use the following line 
# to include all the .pl files in a directory:
# PL_SRCS = $(wildcard *.pl)
# 
# The DOMAIN variable gives the domain name.
#
# To automatically generate all dependencies, the above makefile should
# first be created in a file called "make.template".  The following
# operations will then create the makefile:
#	make -f make.template depend
#
# At this point, if you type "make all", your custom DE stars will be compiled.
# They can then be dynamically linked into Ptolemy.
#
# Note that if this were all you wanted to do, then it would have been
# unnecessary to create the makefile.  The dynamic linker would take care
# of things for you.  But having the above makefile, you can now customize
# it to perform custom functions.
