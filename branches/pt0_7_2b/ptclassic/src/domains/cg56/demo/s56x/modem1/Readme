This modem was designed a built over the course of a semester for an
EECS 224 class project.  The project report for that class contains a
detailed explaination of this modem.  Below are some areas for
improvement.

Ptolemy-internals related:
  - Scalor register allocation.  This would greatly improve the speed
    and code size of the simple blocks used by the AGC.
  - Pointer register allocation.  This would greatly improve the speed
    of the multirate blocks such as the filters and SSI star.
  - Loop schedule.  Get the loop scheduler to work.  Use pointer reg allocation
    to make efficient.
  - Convert to COMPLEX data type.  This would both improve readability
    of the graph, and provide some small speed and code-size improvement. 
  - Get rid of the SSISkew, and instead use BDF.

Modem-design related:
  - Use the quatrature signal for bits.
  - Use a line code like QAM.  (Currently just symbol code).
  - Transfer real data, with byte to bit blocking.
  - Add low-pass or band-bass into the phase splitter for noise (e.g.,
    matched filtering).
  - Use an interpolating filter (*not* upsampling) to cancel the sampling
    error.
