xgraph - Draw a graph on an X11 Display
<P>

<H2><A NAME="sect2" HREF="#toc2"><B>SYNOPSIS</B></A></H2>

<B>xgraph</B> [ options ] [ =WxH+X+Y ]    [    -display
host:display.screen ] [ file ... ]
<P>

<H2><A NAME="sect3" HREF="#toc3"><B>DESCRIPTION</B></A></H2>

The <I>xgraph</I> program draws a graph on an X display given data
read from either data files or from standard input if no
files are specified. It can display up to 64 independent
data sets using different colors and/or line styles for each
set. It annotates the graph with a title, axis labels,
grid lines or tick marks, grid labels, and a legend. There
are options to control the appearance of most components of
the graph.
<P>
The input format is similar to <I>graph</I>(<I>1G</I>) but differs
slightly. The data consists of a number of <I>data</I> <I>sets</I>. Data
sets are separated by a blank line. A new data set is also
assumed at the start of each input file. A data set consists
of an ordered list of points of the form &quot;{directive}
X Y". The directive is either &quot;draw&quot; or &quot;move&quot; and can be
omitted. If the directive is &quot;draw", a line will be drawn
between the previous point and the current point (if a line
graph is chosen). Specifying a &quot;move&quot; directive tells
xgraph not to draw a line between the points. If the directive
is omitted, &quot;draw&quot; is assumed for all points in a data
set except the first point where &quot;move&quot; is assumed. The
&quot;move&quot; directive is used most often to allow discontinuous
data in a data set. The name of a data set can be specified
by enclosing the name in double quotes on a line by itself
in the body of the data set. The trailing double quote is
optional. Overall graphing options for the graph can be
specified in data files by writing lines of the form
&quot;&lt;option&gt;: &lt;value&gt;". The option names are the same as those
used for specifying X resources (see below). The option and
value must be separated by at bleast one space. An example
input file with three data sets is shown below. Note that
set three is not named, set two has discontinuous data, and
the title of the graph is specified near the top of the
file.

<P>
After <I>xgraph</I> has read the data, it will create a new window
to graphically display the data. The interface used to
specify the size and location of this window depends on the
window manager currently in use. Refer to the reference
manual of the window manager for details.
<P>
Once the window has been opened, all of the data sets will
be displayed graphically (subject to the options explained
below) with a legend in the upper right corner of the
screen. To zoom in on a portion of the graph, depress a
mouse button in the window and sweep out a region. <I>xgraph</I>
will then open a new window looking at just that portion of
the graph. <I>xgraph</I> also presents three control buttons in
the upper left corner of each window: <I>Close</I>, <I>Hardcopy</I>, and
<I>About</I>. Windows are closed by depressing a mouse button while
the mouse cursor is inside the <I>Close</I> button. Typing EOF
(control-D) in a window also closes that window. Depressing
a mouse button while the mouse cursor is in the <I>Hardcopy</I>
button causes a dialog to appear asking about hardcopy
(printout) options. These options are described below:
<P>
Output Device<BR>

Specifies the type of the output device (e.g. &quot;HPGL",
&quot;Postscript", etc). An output device is chosen by
depressing the mouse inside its name. The default
values of other fields will change when you select a
different output device.
<P>
Disposition<BR>

Specifies whether the output should go directly to a
device or to a file. Again, the default values of
other fields will change when you select a different
disposition.
<P>
File or Device Name<BR>

If the disposition is &quot;To Device", this field specifies
the device name. A device name is the same as the
name given for the -P command of <A HREF="http://localhost/cgi-bin/man2html?lpr?1">lpr(1)</A>. If the disposition
is &quot;To File", this field specifies the name of
the output file.
<P>
Maximum Dimension<BR>

This specifies the maximum size of the plot on the
hardcopy device in centimeters. <I>xgraph</I> takes in
account the aspect ratio of the plot on the screen and
will scale the plot so that the longer side of the plot
is no more than the value of this parameter. If the
device supports it, the plot may also be rotated on
the page based on the value of the maximum dimension.
<P>
Include in Document<BR>

If selected, this option causes <I>xgraph</I> to produce harcopy
output that is suitable for inclusion in other
larger documents. As an example, when this option is
selected the Postscript output produced by xgraph will
have a bounding box suitable for use with psfig.
<P>
Title Font Family<BR>

This field specifies the name of a font to use when
drawing the graph title. Suitable defaults are initially
chosen for any given hardcopy device. The value
of this field is hardware specific -- refer to the device
reference manual for details.
<P>
Title Font Size<BR>

This field specifies the desired size of the title
fonts in points (1/72 of an inch). If the device supports
scalable fonts, the font will be scaled to this
size.
<P>
Axis Font Family and Axis Font Size<BR>

These fields are like <I>Title</I> <I>Font</I> <I>Family</I> and <I>Title</I> <I>Font</I>
<I>Size</I> except they specify values for the font <I>xgraph</I>
uses to draw axis labels, and legend descriptions.
<P>
Control Buttons<BR>

After specifing the parameters for the plot, the &quot;Ok"
button causes <I>xgraph</I> to produce a hardcopy. Pressing
the &quot;Cancel&quot; button will abort the hardcopy operation.
Depressing the <I>About</I> button causes Xgraph to display a
window containing the version of the program and an
electronic mailing address for the author for comments
and suggestions.
<P>
<I>xgraph</I> accepts a large number of options most of which can
be specified either on the command line, in the user's .Xdefaults
or .Xresources file, or in the data files themselves.
A list of these options is given below. The command line
option is specified first with its X default or data file
name (if any) in parenthesis afterward. The format of the
option in the X defaults file is &quot;program.option: value"
where program is the program name (xgraph) and the option
name is the one specified below. Option specifications in
the data file are similar to the X defaults file specification
except the program name is omitted.
<B>=WxH+X+Y</B> <B>(Geometry)</B><BR>

Specifies the initial size and location of the xgraph
window. <B>-&lt;digit&gt;</B> <B>&lt;name&gt;</B> These options specify the data
set name for the corresponding data set. The digit
should be in the range `0' to `63'. This name will be
used in the legend.
<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>-bar</B> <B>(BarGraph)</B><DD>
Specifies that vertical bars should be drawn from the

Some options can only be specified in the X defaults file or
in the data files. These options are described below:
<P>
<B>&lt;digit&gt;.Color</B><BR>

Specifies the color for a data set. Eight independent
colors can be specified. Thus, the digit should be
between `0' and `7'. If there are more than eight data
sets, the colors will repeat but with a new line style
(see below).
<P>
<B>&lt;digit&gt;.Style</B><BR>

Specifies the line style for a data set. A string of
ones and zeros specifies the pattern used for the line
style. Eight independent line styles can be specified.
Thus, the digit should be between `0' and `7'. If
there are more than eight data sets, these styles will
be reused. On color workstations, one line style is
used for each of eight colors. Thus, 64 unique data
sets can be displayed.
<P>
<B>Device</B><BR>

The default output form presented in the hardcopy dialog
(i.e. &quot;Postscript", &quot;HPGL", etc).
<P>
<B>Disposition</B><BR>

The default setting of whether output goes directly to
a device or to a file. This must be one of the strings
&quot;To File&quot; or &quot;To Device".
<P>
<B>FileOrDev</B><BR>

The default file name or device string in the hardcopy
dialog.
<P>
<B>ZeroWidth</B><BR>

Width, in pixels, of the zero grid line.
<P>
<B>ZeroStyle</B><BR>

Line style pattern of the zero grid line.
