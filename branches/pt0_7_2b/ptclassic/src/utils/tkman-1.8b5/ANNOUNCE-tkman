Ultrix, AT&T System V, SGI IRIX, Linux, SCO, IBM AIX, FreeBSD, BSDI

	"I encourage you to use TkMan for reading man pages. ... 
	Tkman provides an extremely pleasant GUI for browsing man
	pages.  I cannot describe all the nice features of TkMan in
	this small space.  Instead I will merely say that I now
	actually look forward to reading man pages as long as I can do
	it with TkMan."
		-- Don Libes, _Exploring Expect_, page 21

TkMan offers two major advantages over xman: hypertext links to other
man pages (click on a word in the text which corresponds to a man
page, and you jump there), and better navigation within long man pages
with searches (both incremental and regular expression) and jumps to
section headers.  TkMan also offers some convenience features, like a
user-configurable list of commonly used man pages, a one-click
printout, and integration of `whatis' and `apropos'.  Further, one may
highlight, as if with a yellow marker, arbitrary passages of text in
man pages and subsequently jump directly to these passages by
selecting an identifying excerpt from a pulldown menu.  Finally, TkMan
gives one control over the directory-to-menu volume mapping of man
pages with a capability similar to but superior to xman's mandesc in
that rather than forcing all who share a man directory to follow a
single organization, TkMan gives control to the individual.  For example,
one may decide he has no use for a large set of man pages--say for
instance the programmer routines in volumes 2, 3, 4, 8--and eliminate
them from his personal database.  Or a Tcl/Tk programmer may decide
to group Tcl/Tk manual pages in their own volume listing.

Other features include:
* full text search of man pages (with Glimpse, optional)
* when multiple pages match the search name, a pulldown list of all matches
* regular expression searches for manual page names
* a list of recently added or changed manual pages
* a "history" list of recently visited pages
* a user-configurable "shortcuts" or "hot" list
* a preferences panel to control fonts, colors, and other system settings
* compatibility with compressed pages (both source and formatted)
* diagnostics on your manual page installation
* elision of those unsightly page headers and footers,
* and, when asking to print a page available only in formatted form,
  reverse compilation into [tn]roff source, which can then be reformatted
  as good-looking PostScript


Among the NEW features in version 1.8 are:
* Compatibility with Tcl 7.5/Tk 4.1
* Highlight annotations automatically repositioned when man page changes
  (robust across page reformats, once old highlights updated to new style.
  When updating, use your current version of RosettaMan.)
  It is now reasonable to invest effort in highlights with reasonable assurance
  that they'll persist.
* Option for unified Glimpse index (under Preferences/Misc);
  can be used for local indexes.
  (This is in addition to the index-per-MANPATH directory option.)
* Searching backward for regular expressions in a man page
* Command line options summarized as cascade menu under relevant section in 
  Sections menu.  This is especially useful for pages like Tk's canvas, which 
  describes several graphical object types, each with its own set of options.
* Compensation for nonstandardness in GNU and UnixWare sed
* SGI support completely solved (Scott Nelson)
* fixed man.conf support (for BSDI, Linux),
  which is important in the absence of a MANPATH (Hagen Finley)
* on SCO, section names taken from /usr/default/man (Bela Lubkin)
* man page names with colons (as in Perl 5) recognized
* option for single mouse click to activate hyperlink (someone in CS160)
* fixed bug related to find and the recent page list that caused inordinately
  long database build times on some systems (Vinnie Shelton)

Among the NEW features in version 1.7 are:
* Compatibility with Tcl 7.4/Tk 4.0
* Much faster searching within text buffer,
  taking advantage of a new feature in Tk 4.0
* Manual pages read in ~40% less time, once found in the database 
  and filtered through nroff if necessary
* Automated Glimpse indexing of compressed files
  (i.e., .glimpse_filters file created automatically--existing .glimpse_filters
  files are left unchanged)
* Back door to use local man command.  Useful in situations when the MANPATH
  changes frequently.  You do lose some functionality, however.
* Volume listings set in columns for easier reading

Among the NEW features since version 1.5 are:
* database of man page names stored on disk, so once the database is built...
     startup much quicker, searching faster, volume listings faster
     also, the help page comes up much quicker
     In sum, these changes make TkMan much more usable on slower machines.
* full text search through man pages with Glimpse (optional)
* Preferences panel to choose fonts, colors and other options
* list of recently added or changed manual pages
* likely man page references distinguished with typewriter font
  (Michael Harrison)
* hypertext list of all man pages with highlights (Steven S. Dick)
* support for short UNIX file names (for old file systems)
* support for saving formatted pages to H-P's cat.Z directories
* support for LANG environment variable (Yasuro Kawata)
* TKMAN environment variable searched for command line options
* Help file maintained in HTML and automatically converted for use in TkMan.
  This means that one can use a WWW browser to read the help and
  generate a PostScript version to print out.
* incremental searches highlight match
* manual page filter slightly improved (handles OSF and GNU formatting)
* error checking on MANPATH and existence of supporting executables
* support for Linux Filesystem Structure (FSSTND) (Martin Wunderli)
* support for IBM's AIX

Long-time TkMan users can remove bin/bs2tk, lib/taputils.tcl, lib/utils.tcl,
lib/searchbox.tcl.
