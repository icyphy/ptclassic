#### Uninstantiable
# This is the superclass for classes that cannot be instantiated.
# There are a number of these in Tycho, mainly for "managers" of
# things like colors and fonts. Inheriting from this class indicates
# that such a class cannot be instantiated and places the classes neatly
# into the Tycho class hierarchy. All the class contains is a constructor
# that returns an error, thus preventing the class from being
# instantiated.
# 
# Subclasses of this class thus are a collection of procs and common
# variables.
#
# It may be that this function would be better served by [incr Tcl]
# namespaces -- this issue needs to be examined again when the
# Tycho documentation system supports namespaces better.
#
class ::tycho::Uninstantiable {

    constructor {args} {
	error "The [$this info class] class cannot be instantiated"
    }
    destructor {}
