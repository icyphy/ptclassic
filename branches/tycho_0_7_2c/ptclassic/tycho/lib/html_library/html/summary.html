<title>Summary of HTML 2.0</title>
<h1>Tags Supported by the Library</h1>
<dl compact>
<dt>title, /title
<dd>The document title.  No markup is permitted between the opening and
closing tags, otherwise the title string is truncated at the first non
<tt>/title</tt> tag.

<dt>h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6  /h1, /h2, /h3, /h4, /h5, /h6
<dd>Heading levels.

<dt>p, /p (optional)
<dd>Paragraphs are rendered block left, with one blank line.

<dt>pre, /pre 
<dd>Preformatted text.  All whitespace is preserved. Any markup
is permitted inside of a <tt>pre</tt> tag.  Rendered in a mono-spaced font.

<dt>address, /address
<dd>Address delimeters, rendered in an italic font.

<dt>blockquote, /blockquote
<dd>Block quotes nest on the left with the list constructs and
other <tt>blockquote</tt> tags, but the right-margin indent level
does not nest.  They are rendered in italics, with a blank line
above and below.

<dt>ul li... /ul
<dd>Unordered lists.  Rendered with a different marker symbol for
each indent level.  The default symbols are: <b>O*=+-o\xd7\xb0:\xb7</b>

<dt>ol li... /ol
<dd>Ordered lists.  Rendered with a number for each list element.
Each indent level has its own numbering.

<dt>dir li... /dir
<dd>Directory listings.  Rendered the same as unordered lists.

<dt>menu  li... /menu
<dd>Menu lists.  Rendered with a unique (<tt>-&gt;</tt>) list element symbol.

<dt>dl  (dt...,dd)...  /dl
<dd>Definition lists.  There may be multiple <tt>dt</tt> elements per
<tt>dd</tt> element.

<dt>cite
<dd>Citation.  Rendered in italics.
<dt>code
<dd>Code fragment.  Rendered in a mono-spaced font.
<dt>em
<dd>Emphasized.  Rendred in italics.
<dt>kbd
<dd>Keyboard or user input.  Rendered in a bold, mono-spaced font.
<dt>samp
<dd>Sample.  endered in a mono-spaced font.
<dt>strong
<dd>Different from <tt>em</tt>.  Rendered in bold face.
<dt>var
<dd>A variable reference. Rendered in italics.

<dt>b

<dt>i
<dd>Italics
<dt>tt
<dd>A typewriter, or mono-spaced font.
<dt>br
<dd>A line break.
<dt>hr
<dd>A horizontal rule.  Rendered as a full width horizontal line.

<dt>a
<dd>A hyperlink anchor. The supported parameters are
<tt>name</tt> and <tt>href</tt>.  The <i>name</i> parameter is the
target, or destination of a hyperlink.  It can be referenced by using
the <code>HMgoto</code> callback, with <i>name</i> as an argument.<p>
The <tt>href</tt> tag is accessed by two callback routines.
<code>HMlink_setup</code> is called once for each hyperlink.  It
is expected to associate any application specific behavior with
a hyper-link.  The default version of <code>HMlink_setup</code>
arranges for hyperlinks to be highlighted/dehilighted
upon cursor entry and exit.  When the link is activated (with
mouse button 1) <code>HMlink_callback</code>, which is supplied by
the application, is called.<p>
Any additional parameters supplied with the <tt>a</tt> tag are
passed as an argument to the call-back routines.

<dt>img
<dd>An in-line image.  Inline images are obtained in two steps.
First, The <code>align</code>, <code>alt</code>, <code>src</code>, 
and <code>ismap</code> attributes are handled by the library.<p>
As each inline image tag is seen, the procedure (supplied by the
application) <code>HMset_image <i>handle src</i></code> is called.
The application is expected to locate the image (using <i>src</i>,
and create a TK image with it.<p>
The application then calls <code>HM_got_image <i>handle image</i></code>,
where <i>handle</i> was the value passed to <code>HM_set_image</code>, and
<i>image</i> is either the name of a TK image, or an error message.<p>
If the parameter <code>ismap</code> was supplied, then a call to
<code>HMlink_callback</code> is made when the image is clicked on.

<h1>Unsupported tags</h1>
<dl>
<dt>head /head

document display.

<dt>body /body

document display.

<dt>meta /meta
<dd>This tag is used by servers, and has no meaning in the context of
document display.

<dt>base /base

<tt>HMtag_base</tt> and <tt>HMtag_/base</tt> need to be supplied by the 
application.

<dd>This tag does not effect the document display.  The function
<tt>HMtag_link</tt> needs to be supplied by the 
application.

<dd>These tags are deprecated and not supported

</dl>
<h1>Notes</h1>
<ul>
<li>All of the list constructs: ul,ol,menu,dir and dl support
the <tt>compact</tt> attribute, which produces a more compact rendering

<li>If the <tt>li</tt> elements are left off of lists, the
<tt>ul,/ul</tt> or <ol,/ol> pairs act as a <i>indent</i> operator.

<li>No markup may be contained within a <tt>dt</tt> element of a
definition list, although any prevailing font properties are observered.

<li>No markup is permitted between the opening and
closing <tt>title</tt> tags, otherwise the title string is
truncated at the first tag.

<li>The application may supply its own behavior for any html tag, or override
the default behavior by supplying a procedure of the form
<code>HMtag_<i>tag</i></code> or
<code>HMtag_<i>/tag</i></code>, where
<i>tag</i> is the html tag whose behavior is to be defined.  See
the reference manual for details.

<li>The default white space and font style selection for all built-in
tags may be changed by the application by changing values in either
the <code>HMinsert_map</code> or <code>HMtag_map</code>.  See
the manual for details.
</ul>
<h1>Exceptions</h1>
<ul>
<li>The text scrolling behavior is poor when the page contains large
embedded images
<li>In this version, there is no direct way to change the font used
in form data entry fields, you need to use the option database.
<li>Too much white space sometimes gets added when succesive multiple
white-space separated html tags with no plain text are encountered.
</ul>
