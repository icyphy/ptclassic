#
# Usage: mkPtolemyTree <override file> <absolute path of tree root>
#
# The override file is a set of make directives.  By convention, the
# override file is named "override.mk".  The override file gets copied
# into the new tree.  Note that the final sub-directory in the absolute
# path name must not already exist.  It will be created by the script.
#
# A sample override.mk file that will build a VHDL only pigi is below.
# To use this file, remove the leading comment symbols '#' and copy
# the three lines into a file named ~/override.mk
# --start--
# VHDL=1
# DEFAULT_DOMAIN=VHDL
# VERSION_DESC="VHDL only"
# --end--
#
# For a complete list of domains that can be included, see $PTOLEMY/mk/ptbin.mk
#
# Chapter 1 of the Ptolemy Programmer's manual has full documentation
# for mkPtolemyTree
