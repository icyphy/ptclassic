<h2><a href="removedFeatures">Features present in Ptolemy 0.7 that were removed in 0.7.1</a></h2>
<menu>
<li> Many features in Tycho have been removed:
	<menu>
	<li> The TclJava interface has been removed, it does not work
	with JDK1.1.  The new Tcl/Java interface is called TclBlend, but
	it only works with Tcl8.0.  Itcl has not yet been ported to
	Tcl8.0, so we can't use Tcl Blend yet.
	</menu>

<li> CGDDF files have been removed.  CGDDF was never well integrated into
the Ptolemy tree, it required a rebuild.
