<H1>Minor Changes in Ptolemy 0.7.1</H1>
<menu>

<LI> Vem/pigiRpc interlocks to prevent the dreaded "RPC Protocol Error" -
     Tom Lane

<LI> Custom display of universe parameters in run control panels.
     It is now possible to add parameters to the Run Control panel by checking
     check boxes in the Edit Parameters Window.  - Tom Lane

<LI> Support for using the
     <A HREF="http://www.cs.tu-bs.de/softech/ddd/">ddd</A>
     debugger from <CODE>pigi -debug</CODE> - Jens Voigt

<LI> Support for compiling Ptolemy under Solaris 2.5 for the PC using
     PTARCH=sol2.5pc - Dominique Ragot

<li> Support for the Process Network (PN) domain under Linux -
	Wolfgang Reimer 


<li> Script files have been converted from C Shell
	to Bourne shell.  -
	Christopher Hylands
	Wolfgang Reimer 
	 <br>The changed files are:
	<menu>
	<li> <CODE>bin/pigiEnv.csh</CODE> is now
	<CODE>bin/pigiEnv.sh</CODE>, <CODE>bin/pigiEnv.csh</CODE>
	is no longer shipped
	<li> <CODE>bin/ptsetup.csh</CODE> has been converted.
	Both <CODE>bin/ptsetup.csh</CODE> and <CODE>bin/ptsetup.sh</CODE>
	are shipped since there are other scripts that source both versions

	<li> <CODE>$PTOLEMY/MAKEARCH</CODE> has been converted to
	Bourne shell.
	</menu> 

<li> Various bug fixes from Wolfgang Reimer, including:
	<menu>
	<li> Create 2 new Ptolemy targets for Linux (linux.static, linux.debug)
	<li> Work around to allow to use Complex class of GNU libg++
	<li> <CODE>matlab.mk</CODE> and <CODE>mathematica.mk</CODE>
	now allow predefinition of <CODE>MATLABDIR</CODE>
	and <CODE>MATHEMATICADIR</CODE>
	</menu>

For complete details, see
<a href="http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/ptolemy0.7/patches/reimer/index.html"><CODE>http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/ptolemy0.7/patches/reimer/index.html</CODE></a>

<li> VHDL Environment variable changes - Mike Williamson

 <br> Brian Evans reported a bug where SimVSSTarget sets environment
variables even when they are blank, and whatever it sets overrides the
user's shell environment settings.  A further problem was that the
target sets them when it's a child target.  Child target parameters
are not editable from pigi, so if the defaults were wrong, the user could not fix them.

<h2><a name="removedFeatures">Features present in Ptolemy 0.7 that were removed in 0.7.1</a></h2>
<menu>
<li> Many features in Tycho have been removed:
	<menu>
	<li> The TclJava interface has been removed, it does not work
	with JDK1.1.  The new Tcl/Java interface is called TclBlend, but
	it only works with Tcl8.0.  Itcl has not yet been ported to
	Tcl8.0, so we can't use Tcl Blend yet.
	</menu>

<li> CGCDDF files have been removed.  CGCDDF was never well integrated into
the Ptolemy tree, it required a rebuild.
The affected stars are <CODE>CGCSelf</CODE>, <CODE>CGCRepeater</CODE>,
<CODE>CGCLastOfN</CODE>, <CODE>CGCEndCase</CODE>, <CODE>CGCDownCounter</CODE>, <CODE>CGCCase</CODE>.
