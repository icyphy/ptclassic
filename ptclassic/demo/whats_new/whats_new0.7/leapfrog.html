<H1>Cadence Leapfrog Ptolemy Interface</H1>

Xavier Warzee (<CODE>warzee@sctf.thomson-csf.fr</CODE>) of Thomson CSF
and
<A HREF="http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cameron">Michael C. Williamson</A> 
created an interface for the
 <A HREF="http://www.cadence.com/software/qx-leap.html">Cadence
Leapfrog VHDL Simulator</A>.

 <P><A HREF="../../../src/domains/vhdl/targets"><CODE>$PTOLEMY/src/domains/vhdl/targets</CODE></A>
contains the Cadence Leapfrog VHDL Target.
This target, SimLF-VHDL, allows simulation of generated VHDL code with
the Leapfrog simulator from Cadence.  This target is analogous to the
SimVSS-VHDL target, which supports simulation with the Synopsys VHDL
System Simulator.

<H2>Setup</H2>

To use the Leapfrog you need to have the following setup.  Locally, our
Cadence installation is at <CODE>/usr/eesww/cadence</CODE>, so your 
<CODE>.cshrc</CODE> would contain:

<PRE>
setenv PATH /usr/eesww/cadence/9504/tools/leapfrog/bin:$PATH
setenv CDS_LIB /usr/eesww/cadence/9504/tools/leapfrog
setenv CDS_INST_DIR /usr/eesww/cadence/9504 
</PRE>

You also need to set up some files.

 <P>In the directory where the VHDL code in generated, for example
<CODE>~/PTOLEMY_SYSTEMS/VHDL</CODE>, the two following files must be provided :

 <P><CODE>cds.lib</CODE> contains
<PRE>
softinclude $CDS_VHDL/files/cds.lib
define leapfrog ./LEAPFROG
define alt_syn $CDS_INST_DIR/lib/alt_syn
</PRE>

<CODE>hdl.var</CODE> contains:

<PRE>
DEFINE WORK   leapfrog 
include   $CDS_VHDL/files/hdl.var
</PRE>

and the directory <CODE>~/PTOLEMY_SYSTEMS/VHDL/LEAPFROG</CODE>
must exist.
