<H1>Minor Changes in Ptolemy 0.7</H1>
<DL>

<DT>Galaxy Recursion Tests
<DD> Compiling recursive galaxies are warned against.
 <BR> <a href="mailto:tgl@sss.pgh.pa.us">Tom Lane</a> 
(Structured Software Systems), 
<A HREF="http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cxh">Christopher Hylands</A> -

<DT> <CODE>ptcl</CODE> can handle Higher Order Function (HOF) stars.
<DD> <A HREF="http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cxh">Christopher Hylands</A>

<DT> HOF stars are now available in all domains.
<DD><a href="mailto:tgl@sss.pgh.pa.us">Tom Lane</a> 

<DT> Ptolemy0.7 uses <A HREF="http://www.tcltk.com">Itcl 2.2</A>,
	which runs under Tcl 7.6 and Tk4.2.
<DD> The Itcl installation will use shared libraries, where available.
	If you downloaded the <CODE>other.src</CODE> tar file, then the
	<A HREF="../../../src/tcltk/makefile"><CODE>$PTOLEMY/src/tcltk/makefile
</CODE></A> will contain the makefile rules necessary to build Itcl with
	shared libraries.

<DT> Run control window buttons rearranged and relabeled.

<DD>
The <CODE>ABORT</CODE> button in the run control window, which was
formerly hidden in the "debug" controls, has been moved to the place
where <CODE>STOP</CODE> used to be, and has also been given
<CODE>STOP</CODE>'s keyboard equivalent (<CODE>Escape</CODE>).
Conversely, <CODE>STOP</CODE> has been hidden in the "debug" controls,
and has been relabeled <CODE>EARLY END</CODE>.
<p>
The motivation for this change is that <CODE>ABORT</CODE> is actually much
more useful and less dangerous than <CODE>STOP</CODE>, especially for novices.
<CODE>ABORT</CODE> simply terminates the simulation run point-blank,
and is the right thing to use if you decide you don't want to wait
for results.
<CODE>EARLY END</CODE> (nee <CODE>STOP</CODE>) terminates the simulation
as of the point currently reached, but then it runs the wrapup methods
of the stars, just as if the simulation had ended normally.  Thus, it is an
invasive alteration of the behavior of the simulation.  The results displayed
during wrapup may be subtly or wildly different from the results that would
have been obtained if the simulation had been allowed to proceed to its
scheduled end time.  Some of the demos will in fact deliver incorrect,
or at least unexpected, results if stopped early.
<p>
The problem is even greater if a run-control-window script is in use, because
the script will proceed merrily on its way with no idea that one of the
commanded runs has been stopped early.  <CODE>ABORT</CODE> will kill execution
of a run control script, but <CODE>EARLY END</CODE> doesn't --- it just ends
the currently commanded run.
<p>
With all this in mind, <CODE>EARLY END</CODE> is a tool that should be used
only by one who is familiar with the behavior of a particular simulation
and understands the consequences.  So the button is now hidden in the
debug controls, and <CODE>ABORT</CODE> has been made the easier button
to get to.

<DT> <CODE>Make-star</CODE> can create <A NAME="icons that contain html files">icons whose contents are html files</A>.

<DD> <CODE>Make-star</CODE> has been modified so that icons can have html files as their contents.  
 <P> For example, to
create an icon whose contents are the file <CODE>~/pt/myfile.html</CODE>
<OL>
<LI> Move the cursor over a vem window and hit <CODE>*</CODE>

<LI> Type the following values into the <CODE>Make Star</CODE> window:
<MENU>
<LI> <CODE>Star name:</CODE> <CODE>myfile</CODE>

<LI> <CODE>Domain:</CODE> <CODE>NODOMAIN</CODE>

<LI> <CODE>Star src directory:</CODE> <CODE>~/pt</CODE>

<LI> <CODE>Pathnmame of Palette:</CODE> <CODE>./user.pal</CODE>

</MENU>

</OL>
