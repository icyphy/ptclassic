 <P>The CGC TychoTarget is an experimental target that provides a way
to create CGC control panels that use the functionality in Tycho.  A
universe that uses TychoTarget must provide a script that creates the
control panel that the user sees. Currently, all the TychoTarget demos
implement real-time audio processing demos, and will only work on Sun
work-stations.

 <P>For information about the Sun Audio system, see <A
HREF="sunaudio.html">the Sun Audio page</A>.

<a name="setup"></a>
<H2>TychoTarget setup</H2>

<I></I>To use the TychoTarget, you will need to run <CODE>cd
$PTOLEMY/tycho; make tclexts</CODE>.  TychoTarget uses
<CODE>$PTOLEMY/tycho/obj.$PTARCH/tcl.mk</CODE> and
<CODE>java.mk</CODE>.

<a name="using"></a>
<H2>Using TychoTarget</H2>

<p>To use TychoTarget, simply select TychoTarget from the Targets menu
in your VEM window. By default, TychoTarget is set to compile the
generated file, start a separate Tycho process, and load the generated
system into Tycho. The generated file can also be compiled and loaded
into a running Tycho "by hand" -- see below.

 <P>The key setting in the TychoTarget parameters window is the name
of the TychoTarget script file -- this is a Tcl file that is sourced
by the generated file after it has been loaded into Tycho, and is
where the control panel that the user sees is created. The scripts for
the TychoTarget demos are located in <A
HREF="../../../tycho/typt/demo"><code>$TYCHO/typt/demo</code></A>. By
convention, the name of the script file is the name of the Ptolemy
universe with suffix <CODE>.tcl</CODE>. For each script file, there is
also an HTML help file with suffix <CODE>.html</CODE>.

 <P>Each star in your universe that can be controlled by TychoTarget
in real-time must have a unique identifier. Currently, this is
in the Edit Parameters window of the star as the <CODE>starName</CODE>
state.

<h3>Output file format</h3>

 <P>TychoTarget generates a C file in a format that can be loaded into
Tycho as a Tcl package. The Tcl package format is the standard one
(see the book <I>Tcl and the Tk Toolkit</I> by John K. Ousterhout for
details). Apart from the Tcl package interface, the generated file
differs from that produced by the TclTkTarget in the following ways:

<ul>

<li> Instead of a single <CODE>main()</CODE> function, TychoTarget
generates three functions: <CODE>setup()</CODE>,
<CODE>execute()</CODE>, and <CODE>wrapup()</CODE>. These are called by
Tycho to manage execution of the program. (In theory, this allows us
to execute multiple generated systems within the one Tycho, but we
haven't demonstrated this yet.)

<LI> Because the execution has been split into seperate function,
variables are now at the file scope and marked <CODE>static</CODE> to
prevent name collisions with other packages.

<LI> Execution is controlled by Tycho rather than by the geenrated
code. Each time <CODE>execute()</CODE> is called, it is obliged to
return start the C timer and return when the timer expires. This is in
contrast to the TclTkTarget, in which the main loop starts the timer,
checks it on each iteration, and calls the Tk event loop when it
expires. (In effect, it's upside-down.)

</ul>

 <P>The Tcl package format consists of two functions: an
initialization function called
<CODE><i>universe-name</i>_Init()</CODE>, which adds a new Tcl command
<CODE>::tycho::<I>universe-name</I></CODE> to Tycho, and a Tcl
interface function called (surprisingly enough..)
<CODE>tclinterface()</CODE>. This function is included directly from
the file <A
HREF="../../../src/tycgc/tclif.c">$PTOLEMY/tycho/src/tycgc/tclif.c</A>.


 <P>The Tcl command <CODE>::tycho::<I>universe-name</I></CODE> is used by the
Tycho scheduler class to execute the universe. Its first argument
controls what happens in the (generated) package:

<ul>
<LI><B>scriptfile</B>: Return the name of the user interface script
file set in the TychoTarget parameters window in VEM.
<LI><B>init</B>: Call the <CODE>tychoSetup()</CODE> function,
causing stars to tell Tycho what to do when controls
are moved by the user.
<LI><B>setup</B>: Call the <CODE>setup()</CODE> function. If
an additional argument is called, it is the name of a Tcl
variable that is updated with the iteration count after
each call to <CODE>execute()</CODE>.
<LI><B>execute</B>: Execute the universe until the C timer
expires (by default, Tycho sets this to 20 ms).
Update the Tcl iteration counter if one was specified
in the setup call.
<LI><B>wrapup</B>: Call the <CODE>wrapup()</CODE> function.
</ul>

<h3>What TychoTarget does</h3>

By default, running a TychoTarget universe will:

<ul>

<li>Create files called <CODE><I>universe-name</I>.c</CODE>
<CODE><I>universe-name</I>_ld.tcl</CODE> in the directory
<CODE>~/PTOLEMY_SYSTEMS/TYCHO</CODE>.

<LI> Call the <CODE>::tycho::compileC</CODE> procedure within the
Tycho running in Ptolemy to compile the file, generating
<CODE>.o</CODE> and <CODE>.so</CODE> files.

<LI> Exec another Tycho process, passing the
<CODE><I>universe-name</I>_ld.tcl</CODE> filename as an argument that
Tycho will execute. The <CODE><I>universe-name</I>_ld.tcl</CODE>
causes Tycho to load the <CODE><I>universe-name</I>.so</CODE> library,
and then execute the user interface script file. In the process,
Tycho will load the <A HREF="../../../tycho/src/tytimer">TyTimer</A>
and <A HREF="../../../tycho/src/tycgc">TyCGC</A> support packages.

</ul>

<h3>Running "by hand"</h3>

Starting a new Tycho propcess every time you run the universe is a
little tedious. To compile a Tycho-Target generated file from within a
running Tycho, simply open the file, and then select "Compile" from
the File menu.  To run a generated application from within a running
Tycho, simply "open" the shared library: Tycho will load the package
and source the user interface script.

<a name="stars"></a>
<h2>Modifying stars for use with TychoTarget</h2>

 <P>Each star that has a state that can be controlled in real-time by
Tycho needs a unique, user-settable identifier. Currently, those stars
that support TychoTarget have a state called <CODE>starName</CODE>
that the user can set from the Edit parameters window.

 <P>Each star that has a state that can be controlled in real-time
must add code to the <CODE>tychoSetup</CODE> code-block. This
code-block serves the same purpose as the <CODE>tkSetup</CODE>
code-block used with the TclTkTarget -- we introduced a new codeblock
because the interface functions to TychoTarget are different.  Here is
a sample code-block (from <A
HREF="../../../src/domains/cgc/tcltk/stars/CGCTkStereoIn.pl">$PTOLEMY/src/domains/cgc/tcltk/stars/CGCTkStereoIn.pl</A>:

<pre>
codeblock (tychoSetup) {
    /* Call tycho to connect a control to the volume parameter */
    connectControl(
	moduleName,
	"$val(starName)",
	"volume",
        $starSymbol(setVolume));
}
</pre>

The arguments are:
<ol>
<LI>The name of the universe. Tycho needs this to
know which control panel will be controlling this parameter.
<LI> The unique name of this star within this universe.
Together with the next argument, this is used by Tycho to
"connect" a user-interface control widget to the callback
that modifies a state in real-time.
<LI> The name of the star parameter being controlled. This does not
have to be the same as the state that actually gets altered at run-time.
<LI> The call-back that Tycho will call to change the parameter. This
is in the standard Tcl call-back format, as for
TclTkTarget. TychoTarget will usually use the same call-backs already
provided by a star for TclTkTarget.
</ol>

 <P>Currently, <CODE>connectControl</CODE> is the only interface
function provided. It is intended for controls that provide input over
a range, such as 0 to 100. It is implemented in the <A
HREF="../../../tycho/src/tycgc">TyCGC</A> support package. In future,
other interface functions will be added for one-of-many selection, so
that buttons can be added to custom interfaces.


<a name="interface"></a>
<h2>Writing TychoTarget user interface scripts</h2>

 <P>Tycho contains support to make it easy to create custom user
interfaces for TychoTarget universes. One good source of information,
of course, is the existing demonstration files, in <A
HREF="../../../tycho/typt/demo"><code>$TYCHO/typt/demo</code></A>.

 <P>The documentation on the operation of the Tycho portion of
TychoTarget is in the Tycho documentatation tree:

<ul>

<li><A HREF="../../../tycho/kernel/doc/codeDoc/ControlPanel.html">The
<CODE>ControlPanel</CODE> class</A>, which is the top-level window
that control panels are embedded in. This class also manages
the calling interface between slider and button widgets and the
underlying C code generated by TychoTarget.

<li><A
HREF="../../../tycho/kernel/doc/codeDoc/ControlPanel_rel.html">The
<CODE>::tycho::controlpanel</CODE> procedure</A>, which is responsible
for loading the compiled TychoTarget package.

<li><A
HREF="../../../tycho/kernel/doc/codeDoc/ControlSubpanel.html">The
ControlSubpanel class</A>, which is the superclass for
application-specific control panels. The current TychoTarget demos use
a number of these sub-panels, in the directory <A
HREF="../../../tycho/typt/controls"><code>$PTOLEMY/tycho/typt/controls</CODE></a>.

<li><A HREF="../../../tycho/kernel/doc/codeDoc/Scheduler.html">The
Scheduler class</A>, which is responsible for executing the
TychoTarget application.

</ul>

<h2>Bugs and caveats</h2>

<ul>

<LI> Initially, TclTkTarget was intended to generate stand-alone C
programs. Over the years, it has changed so that many stars now depend
on header files and libraries in Ptolemy to compile and link.
TychoTarget, however, was written to use Tycho's compilation
facilities, which are not supposed to know about Ptolemy. So, stars
that depend on libraries such as <CODE>ptdsp</CODE> or on header files
such as those in <CODE>$PTOLEMY/src/ptklib</CODE> will not currently work with TychoTarget.

<LI> Stars that do not contain the <CODE>tychoSetup</CODE> code-block
will run with TychoTarget but their parameters cannot be accessed from
Tycho.

<LI> TychoTarget depends on the real-time facilities provided
in the <A HREF="../../../tycho/src/tytimer">TyTimer</A> package. This
package is somewhat machine-dependent -- if it does not work on your
machine then TychoTarget will not either.

<LI> The <A
HREF="../../../tycho/kernel/doc/codeDoc/Scheduler.html">Scheduler</A>
class in Tycho that manages execution of universe depends on the way
that the Tcl <CODE>update</CODE> command works. Anything that deals
with Tcl <CODE>update</CODE> is inherently flaky. We still need to do
more work on making the scheduling more robust.
