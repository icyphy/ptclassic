<H1>Ptolemy Type System Changes</H1>

Tom Lane (Structured Software Systems) has redesigned the type
resolution system in Ptolemy, fixing a number of anomalies. The key
changes are that types propagate forwards through forks rather than
backwards, that members of multiportholes are no longer constrained
to have the same data type, and that higher-order functions in the HOF
domain are evaluated in a new pre-initialization phase of execution.
This solves a number of problems:

<MENU>
<LI> When a fork delivers particles to inputs of different types, the type
  conversion(s) will occur at the fork outputs rather than the output of
  the source star.  This allows different conversions, or no conversion,
  to be performed as appropriate for each recipient.  A minor disadvantage
  is that duplicate conversions may be performed.  (This can be worked around
  by inserting an explicit type conversion star before the fork, if
  performance is critical.)

<LI> Input ANYTYPE multiportholes can accept particles of different types
  from different sources.  This is an essential capability for polymorphic
  stars like Printer.  Each member port of the multiporthole is assigned
  the type of the source port it's connected to.

<LI> In a star like Merge, the constraint that output type = input type
  will still constrain the input multiporthole members individually.
  Thus, the DE Merge will still require that all input types be the same,
  as it should.

<LI> HOF stars now rewire the schematic before porthole type assignment;
  this fixes a lot of problems.  For example, HOFNop used to improperly
  constrain all the connections passing through it to be of the same type.
  Now, porthole type assignment is the same as it would be if the schematic
  were written out in full, without any HOF stars.  Another benefit is that
  the type-specific variants of HOFSrc are no longer necessary; there is
  only one generic HOFSrc.
