To print out the entire manual, make sure your PRINTER environment
variable is set.  If it isn't (if echo $PRINTER says the variable is
undefined) you can type (for csh)

	setenv PRINTER lw
where "lw" is replaced with the name of your printer.

The manual is divided into four volumes: the User's Manual,
Programmer's Manual, Kernel Manual, and Star Atlas.  Each manual is a
collection of postscript files in the directory users_man, prog_man,
kernelManual, or star_atlas.  To print out one of the manuals, cd to
the appropriate directory and then use the "print_manual" command.

For example, to print the User's Manual:

	cd $PTOLEMY/doc/users_man
	print_manual


The directories header and bin are used to print the star
documentation that is automatically generated ptlang.


Below are the steps necessary to run Ptolemy Classic on a remote machine:
  1. Start up Exceed
  2. Start up ssh

  3. Set up ssh to have X forwarding turned on
     Note that you cannot enable Tunnelling if ssh is already
     logged in to a machine, you must disconnect first.
     Do: Edit -> Settings and then select Tunnelling (under Profile
     -> Connection) and click 'Tunnel X11 connections'.


  4. Use ssh to connect to the remote machine

  5. In the ssh window, type: 

setenv PTOLEMY ~ptolemy
cd ~ptolemy
source .cshrc
unsetenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH
setenv PT_USE_X11_PXGRAPH yes
xterm &amp;
pigi


Notes
-----

Ptolemy Classic uses the shift middle button to bring up
a menu of commands.  If your mouse does not have a middle button,
try pressing the left and right mouse buttons at the same time.

Try to avoid using the Window toolbar close window button in
the upper right (the box with the <CODE>X</CODE>) - this button
tends to close all the Ptolemy Classic windows.  To close a 
Ptolemy Classic window, type Control-D.

If the shift middle button menu is totally black, then try
setting your display to 256 colors and restarting the X server.
If you cannot set the display to 256 colors, then
try installing the Cygwin X server by running
the Cygwin "setup" command.  

Then run "xinit &" in a Cygwin bash shell.
When X starts up, start up a window manager by typing
"twm &" in the terminal that comes up.
Then, in the ssh window on the remote host, run
pigi &"


If an entire window comes up black, try iconifying it and
deiconfying it.

Installing under Linux
----------------------

1. Download
The Ptolemy 0.7.2devel release is at

http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cxh/ptdevel
	user:   ptdevel
	password: ptrules


The NT port is fairly difficult to build, and is fairly slow because
of signal limitations in cygwin.  There are no Windows binaries available.
See doc/html/nt/ for details

 <p>Download by following the links above or using scp if you
have an account:

cd /root
mkdir downloads
cd downloads
scp ptII@andrews:/vol/andrews/andrews2/ftp/pub/ptolemy/ptolemy0.7.2devel/pt0.7.2devel.other.src.tar.gz .
scp ptII@andrews:/vol/andrews/andrews2/ftp/pub/ptolemy/ptolemy0.7.2devel/pt0.7.2devel.src.tar.gz .
scp ptII@andrews:/vol/andrews/andrews2/ftp/pub/gnu/ptolemy0.7.2devel/pt0.7.2devel.gnu.tar.gz  .


2. Follow the instructions in

Editing the Ptolemy Classic Source Tree
---------------------------------------
In August, 2005, Ptolemy Classic was checked in to the
source.eecs.berkeley.edu CVS repository.  To edit files in Ptolemy Classic,
do

1. Get a CVS account on <CODE>source.eecs</CODE> or use anonymous CVS

CVS accounts are available for local users, see
http://chess.eecs.berkeley.edu/options/request/cvsacct

Check out the tree with:

cvs -d :ext:source.eecs.berkeley.edu:/home/cvs co ptclassic

OR
Use anonymous cvs

cvs -d :pserver:anon@source.eecs.berkeley.edu:/home/cvs/cvsanon login
   # No password needed, hit enter
cvs -d :pserver:anon@source.eecs.berkeley.edu:/home/cvs/cvsanon co ptclassic


2.  Rename ptclassic to ptolemy.
The reason is that the gcc-2.95.3 tar file has
ptolemy as its top level.

   mv ptclassic ptolemy


3. Download the gcc-2.95.3 Ptolemy specific source files.
gcc-3.x will not work here, you must use gcc-2.95.3

http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cxh/ptdevel/pt0.7.2devel.gnu.tar.gz
	user:   ptdevel
	password: ptrules



4. Untar the gcc-2.95.3 sources from the directory
_above_ the ptolemy directory

   gtar -zxf /tmp/pt0.7.2devel.gnu.tar.gz


5. Download the other.src tar file, which includes the Tcl/Tk sources.
http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cxh/ptdevel/pt0.7.2devel.other.src.tar.gz


Unfortunately, the other.src tar file include the Tcl/Tk sources
and the octtools sources, which we do not want, so we untar it
elsewhere and move the Tcl/Tk sources.


    mkdir tmp
    cd tmp
    gtar -zxf /tmp/pt0.7.2devel.other.src.tar.gz
    mv ptolemy/src/tcltk/* ../ptolemy/src/tcltk/


6. Go back to the ptolemy directory we created with CVS:

   cd ../ptolemy



7. Do the setup:

    setenv PTOLEMY `pwd`
    source ucb-.cshrc
    make bootstrap >& boot.out &



8. Problems

  - GNU make is preferred
    "<CODE>make bootstrap</CODE>" tries to build and install GNU make.
    but it does not always work.  You may need to run

      make install_gnu

    a few times to get everything built

   - xv does not build
    The xv license is rather draconian, so we can distribute
    fixes to the code so we are not shipping it.
