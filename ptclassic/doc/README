To print out the entire manual, make sure your PRINTER environment
variable is set.  If it isn't (if echo $PRINTER says the variable is
undefined) you can type (for csh)

	setenv PRINTER lw
where "lw" is replaced with the name of your printer.
Then
	% cd ~ptolemy/doc
	% make print

You no longer need write permission in the ptolemy directories to print
the manual.  You do need to be able to write to your OWN home directory --
files named Almagest.main and Almagest.index are created there.

You no longer need to have the "ditroff" program to print out the manual.
It is now possible to print the manual using the "groff" program from the
Free Software Foundation.  If you wish to use groff, follow the 
instructions in the $PTOLEMY/doc/main/documents/overall file.

The manual currently consists of the following
sections:
	sect 1: general Ptolemy documentation
	sects 2-N: Domain-specific documentation

To print only sect 1, 
	% cd ~ptolemy/doc/main
	% make print

To print only certain pages of sect 1, for example, pages 48 through the end,
	% make OPTIONS=-o48- print
(note that if you print only certain pages, you may generate an incomplete
index file.  To avoid this, be sure your page range includes the last page
of the document. For example, if you want pages 10-12, and page 55 is the
last one, then use the command:
	% make OPTIONS=-o10-12,55- print

To print a subsection of sect 1, such as the pigi chapter,
	% cd ~ptolemy/doc/main/pigi
	% make print

To print an updated index after printing a new subsection
	% cd ~ptolemy/doc
	% make prindex

To print only a domain-specific document, for example sdf,
	% cd ~ptolemy/src/domains/sdf/doc
	% make print

To preview a section, change to its directory and type "make preview".

A separate manual that describes the kernel at a programmer's level is
in the subdirectory kernelManual.
