To print out the entire manual, make sure your PRINTER environment
variable is set.  If it isn't (if echo $PRINTER says the variable is
undefined) you can type (for csh)

	setenv PRINTER lw
where "lw" is replaced with the name of your printer.

The manual is divided into four volumes.  At this time,
only the first volume is available.  To print it:

	cd $PTOLEMY/doc/users_man
	print_manual
