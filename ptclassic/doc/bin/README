$Id$

This directory contains scripts for printing out or previewing the
Ptolemy documentation.  There are two possible configurations:
as shipped, the ditroff program prints the documentation, and
the xditview program is used as the previewer.

It is also possible to configure this directory to use groff, the
Free Software Foundation replacement for troff and associated tools.
You'll need to install groff on your own (including the X previewer),
and make sure it is on users' paths.

Running USE_GROFF sets things up to use groff.  Running USE_DITROFF
reverts to the original installation.
