<H1>Ptolemy NT Overview</H1>
These pages describe the Ptolemy port to Windows NT4.0.
 <P>
The NT port works, but has not been tested extensively.
Currently, under NT4.0 with
<A HREF="http://www.cygnus.com/cygwin">Cygwin</A> (version b20.1), prebuilt Cygnwin X11R6 binaries and an X server, we can run 
<CODE>pigi</CODE>, the Ptolemy Interactive Graphical Interface.

 <P>
There are two NT ports: <CODE>nt4</CODE> and <CODE>nt4.vc</CODE>.

<H2><CODE>nt4</CODE></H2>
If the <CODE>PTARCH</CODE> environment variable is set to <CODE>nt4</CODE>,
then we build with Cygwin, which is a port of the GNU tools 
to Windows.  <CODE>nt4</CODE> is easier to port because Cygwin
allows us to use the Unix GNU makefiles in the regular distribution.
 <P>The <CODE>nt4</CODE> port requires that Cygwin be present.
The port was done with version <CODE>b20.1</CODE> of Cygwin
 <p>The two biggest problems with the <CODE>nt4</CODE> port is
that it is slow, and incremental linking of stars is not supported.

<H2><CODE>nt4.vc</CODE></H2>
If <CODE>PTARCH</CODE> is set to <CODE>nt4.vc</CODE>, then we use
Microsoft Windows Visual C++ 5.0.  This port relies on using
<CODE>makefile.vc</CODE> files which are MS VC++ versions of the
usually <CODE>makefile</CODE>s.  
 <P> The <CODE>nt4.vc</CODE> port does not yet work, there
are problems creating dlls.  The <CODE>nt4.vc</CODE> port
has not been built recently, and probably does not work.
 <P> Currently, we can only compile <CODE>ptcl.ptiny</CODE>
using MSVC++.  This port is substantially incomplete.
See <CODE>$PTOLEMY/mk/config-nt4.vc.mk.vc</CODE> for
<CODE>nt4.vc</CODE> installation instructions.

<H2>Questions</H2>
<DL>
<DT> Will these ports work under Windows '95?
<DD> We were unable to compile Ptolemy under Windows '95 and Cygwin32 b19.1
without hanging Windows '95 and forcing a reboot.  

<DT> When will the <CODE>nt4.vc</CODE> port be completed?
<DT> The <CODE>nt4</CODE> port has higher priority, so after
<CODE>pigi</CODE> works under <CODE>nt4</CODE>, we may start
work on the <CODE>nt4.vc</CODE> port.
