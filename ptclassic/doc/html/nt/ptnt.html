<H1>Ptolemy NT Overview</H1>
These pages describe the Ptolemy port to Windows NT4.0.
 <P>
The NT port works, but has not been tested extensively.
Currently, under NT4.0 with
<A HREF="http://www.cygnus.com/gnu-win32">Cygnus GNU-win32</A> (version b19.1), prebuilt Cygnwin32 X11R6 binaries and an X server, we can run 
<CODE>pigi</CODE>, the Ptolemy Interactive Graphical Interface.

 <P>
There are two NT ports: <CODE>nt4</CODE> and <CODE>nt4.vc</CODE>.

<H2><CODE>nt4</CODE></H2>
If the <CODE>PTARCH</CODE> environment variable is set to <CODE>nt4</CODE>,
then we build with Cygnus GNU-win32, which is a port of the GNU tools 
to Windows.  <CODE>nt4</CODE> is easier to port because Cygnus GNU-win32
allows us to use the Unix GNU makefiles in the regular distribution.
 <P>The <CODE>nt4</CODE> port requires that Cygnus GNU-win32 be present.
The port was done with version <CODE>b19</CODE> of GNU-win32.

<H2><CODE>nt4.vc</CODE></H2>
If <CODE>PTARCH</CODE> is set to <CODE>nt4.vc</CODE>, then we use
Microsoft Windows Visual C++ 5.0.  This port relies on using
<CODE>makefile.vc</CODE> files which are MS VC++ versions of the
usually <CODE>makefile</CODE>s.  
 <P> The <CODE>nt4.vc</CODE> port does not yet work, there
are problems creating dlls.  The <CODE>nt4.vc</CODE> port
has not been built recently, and probably does not work.

<H2>Questions</H2>
<DL>
<DT> Will these ports work under Windows '95?
<DD> We were unable to compile Ptolemy under Windows '95 and Cygwin32 b19.1
without hanging Windows '95 and forcing a reboot.  

<DT> When will the <CODE>nt4.vc</CODE> port be completed?
<DT> The <CODE>nt4</CODE> port has higher priority, so after
<CODE>pigi</CODE> works under <CODE>nt4</CODE>, we may start
work on the <CODE>nt4.vc</CODE> port.
