<h2>Release notes</h2>
Below are some common problems that you might run across with 0.7.1.

<menu>
<li> <a href="#compatibility">0.7.1 and 0.7.1p2 Compatbility</a>
<li> <a href="#egcs">EGCS and GCC-2.8</a>
<li> <a href="#pxgraph">Pxgraph</a>
</menu>

<h3><a name="compatibility">0.7.1 and 0.7.1p2 Compatibility</a></h3>
<menu>
<li> A Ptolemy 0.7.1 vem should not work with a Ptolemy 0.7.1p2 pigiRpc.

<li> A major feature of Ptolemy 0.7.1p2 is that Itcl was upgraded from
Itcl 2.2 to Itcl3.0.  Any stars that use Tcl or Tk will definitely need to
be recompiled.  

 <br>We are not that confident of the Tycho part of the port to Tcl8.0.  The
main problem seems to be in menu traversals, though there are problems
with search and replace as well.  It is usable with Ptolemy, but it is
not very polished.  This could present a problem to you, depending on
how much you are using Tycho in your product.  You might be better off
sticking with Itcl2.2

 <br>Between Itcl2.2 and Itcl3.0, the directory structure changed, so I've
made changes to 0.7.1p2 to reflect that change.  The biggest changes
are that
 <br>$PTOLEMY/tcltk/itcl is now $PTOLEMY/tcltk/tcl
$PTOLEMY/tcltk/tcl.$PTARCH is now $PTOLEMY/tcltk/tcl.$PTARCH

 <br>The location of the libraries in the subdirectories has also changed. 

 <br>As a result, many of the scripts in $PTOLEMY/bin and the makefiles in 
$PTOLEMY/mk have changed.

 <br>We could have probably forced Itcl3.0 to install in the same
directories as Itcl2.2, but it would have required rewriting some
of the makefiles that ship with Itcl/Tcl/Tk.

 <br>There were a few changes in the code itself, but we left those #defined
so that Itcl2.2 should be usable without too many changes.

 <br>The version of Tycho that is shipped with the 0.7.1p2 patch is 
not at all backward compatible with Itcl2.2.  To use Itcl2.2, it would
be best to drop in the version of Tycho that shipped with 
Ptolemy 0.7.1p1

<li> Ptolemy 0.7.1p2 also includes
an upgrade of the compiler from egcs-1.0.2 to egcs-1.1.
In general, <CODE>.o</CODE> files built under Ptolemy 0.7
will need to be recompiled for use with Ptolemy 0.7.1

</menu>

<h3><a name="egcs">EGCS and GCC-2.8</a></h3>

Ptolemy 0.7.1p2 should compile with gcc-2.7.2.2, but the default
compiler we build the binaries with is egcs-1..1  egcs is a 
compiler effort that builds on the gcc compiler.  The egcs sources are
made available to the gcc maintainers, so egcs changes eventually
should be in egcs.  It seems like egcs is much more active than gcc,
for example egcs-1.0.2 was much more stable than gcc-2.8.1.
 <p> Note that under gcc-2.8.2,
compiling with -O -fPIC causes an internal compiler error when
compiling <CODE>Block.cc</CODE>, so we are shipping with egcs.


 <p>For more information about egcs, see
<A HREF="http://egcs.com/egcs/"><CODE>http:/egcs.cygnus.com</CODE></A>.

 <p>The most common problem with using egcs is that
<CODE>libg++</CODE> is no longer used, so certain include files, such
as <CODE>std.h</CODE> are not found at compile time 
and certain symbols, such as
<CODE>ACG::ACG(unsigned int, int)</CODE> are missing at link time.
 <p>Usually, doing a <CODE>make clean; make install</CODE> 
will solve the problem. 
 <p>The way we work around this is by defining <CODE>-DPT_EGCS</CODE>
in <CODE>config-egcs.mk</CODE> and then including that makefile
in the <CODE>config-<I>$PTARCH</I>.mk</CODE> file instead of
<CODE>config-g++.mk</CODE>.

 <p>Note that egcs does not need <CODE>libg++</CODE>, so the
<CODE>SYSLIBS</CODE> makefile variable is set to not include
<CODE>-lg++</CODE>

<h3><a name="pxgraph">Pxgraph</a></h3>
Pxgraph has been converted to Java.  See
the troubleshooting guide at.
<a href="http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/java/ptolemy.plot2.0/ptolemy/plot/doc/internals/troubleshooting.html"><CODE>$PTOLEMY/tycho/java/ptolemy/plot/doc/internals/troubleshooting.html</CODE></a>

If you don't have Java, see
<a href="ftp://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/pub/misc/xgraph/index.html"><CODE>ftp://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/pub/misc/xgraph/index.html</CODE></a>
for pxgraph X11 binaries and sources.  See
<a href="pxgraph.README.txt"><CODE>$PTOLEMY/src/pxgraph/README.txt</CODE></a> for details.

 <p>To run the Java version of pxgraph, you must do one of the following:
<ol>
<li> Set the <CODE>JAVAHOME</CODE> environment variable to point
to the directory where the Java Development Kit is installed.
For example, your <CODE>.cshrc</CODE> might contain
<pre>
setenv JAVAHOME /opt/jdk1.1.5
</pre>

<li> If you do not set <CODE>JAVAHOME</CODE>, then the pxgraph
script will search your path for the <CODE>javac</CODE> binary.
If <CODE>javac</CODE> is found, then the directory above it
is used for the value of <CODE>JAVAHOME</CODE>

<li> You can also edit <CODE>$PTOLEMY/bin/pxgraph</CODE> directly
and adjust the <CODE>JAVADEFAULT</CODE> variable.
</ol>
