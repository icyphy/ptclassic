One of the key objective of the \*(PT design environment
is to support coexistence and interaction of diverse
computational models, called \fIdomains\fR.
For instance, a dataflow domain can exist within a discrete-event
domain, so that for example
a signal processing subsystem can be cleanly incorporated
within a communication network simulation.
In the \fBPtolemaic\fR cosmology, elementary operators are called 
.c Star s,
higher level functions are called 
.c Galaxy s,
and an entire
application is called a 
.c Universe .
A \fBPtolemaic\fR domain is implemented as a C++ object called a
.c Wormhole .
A 
.c Wormhole 
is derived from the 
.c class\ Star , 
and behaves externally like any other
.c Star .  
Internally, however, it encapsulates an entire foreign
domain invisible from the outside domain.
The internal computational model can be totally different
from the external model, in that the specification language,
semantics, and scheduling paradigm can be totally different.

The interface
between different domains is accomplished by first converting data packets
to a format compatible with the
universal 
.c EventHorizon ,
and then converting to a format compatible
with the second domain.
This document illustrates the detailed mechanism of the domain interface.
