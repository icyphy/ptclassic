Five domains are included in the
0.3
release of \*(PT :
SDF, DE, DDF, THOR, and CG
(we have developed other experimental domains that are not part of
the distribution).
The source code, demos, and documentation for these domains is contained
in ~ptolemy/src/domains/xxx, where ``xxx'' is the domain name (in lower
case letters).
These domains can be mixed arbitrarily to compose a complicated
system.  Any wormhole may contain any other wormhole
to make a hierarchical structure (exception: it is not currently
possible to define a wormhole whose outer domain is CG and whose
inner domain is something else).
Combinations of the two timed domains, DE and THOR, have rigorously tested
our method of mixing timed domains.
The timed nature of the SDF domain has proven 
well behaved with the DE domain.
