Nine domains are included in the
0.4
release of \*(PT :
two timed domains (DE and THOR),
and seven untimed domains (SDF, DDF, CG, CG-DDF, CGC, CG56, and CG96).
We have developed other experimental domains that are not part of
the distribution.
The source code, demos, and documentation for these domains is contained
in ~ptolemy/src/domains/xxx, where ``xxx'' is the domain name (in lower
case letters).
These domains can be mixed arbitrarily to compose a complicated
system.  Any wormhole may contain any other wormhole
to make a hierarchical structure (exception: it is not currently
possible to define a wormhole whose outer domain is one of the code
generation domains (CGxx) and whose
inner domain is something else).
