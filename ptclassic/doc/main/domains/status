Currently, we have four domains in \*(PT : SDF, DE, DDF, CAPSIM.
These domains can be mixed arbitrarily to compose a complicated
system.  Any 
.c Wormhole
may contain other
.c Wormhole s
to make a hierarchical structure.
Since they use nothing but the universal\**
.c Particle s
for now, no example of data-format conversion is apparent.

\**Sure, they may use other types of \fBParticles\fR.
