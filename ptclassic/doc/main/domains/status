Currently, we have at least four domains in \*(PT : SDF, DE, DDF, and CAPSIM.
The source code, demos, and documentation for these domains is contained
in ~ptolemy/src/domains/xxx, where ``xxx'' is the domain name (in lower
case letters).
These domains can be mixed arbitrarily to compose a complicated
system.  Any wormhole may contain any other wormhole
to make a hierarchical structure.
Two domains are to be added in the near future : THOR, and MQ.
Currently, the DE domain s the only timed domain.  After the THOR domain
is incorporated, our scheme of timing management will be rigorously
tested.  The timed nature of the SDF domain has proven 
well behaved with the DE domain.
