.H1 "Wormhole
.pp
The base
.c Wormhole\ class
is derived from 
.c class\ Runnable 
that is also the base class of 
.c class\ Universe .
.c class\ Runnable
is characterized by pointers to a component
.c Galaxy
and a
.c Scheduler .
Like a
.c Universe ,
a 
.c Wormhole
can perform the scheduling actions on the component
.c Galaxy.
A
.c Wormhole
is different from a
.c Universe
in that it is not a self-contained object. Instead, it is triggered
by other block to initiate the scheduling.
.pp
Each domain has a derived 
.c Wormhole\ class .
For example, the SDF domain has 
.c class\ SDFWormhole .
This domain-specific
.c Wormhole
is derived from not only the base
.c Wormhole\ class
but also the domain-specific star class,
.c SDFStar .
The multiple inheritance realizes the inherent nature of the
.c Wormhole .
First, the
.c Wormhole
behaves exactly like a
.c Star
from the outer domain (SDF) since it is derived from 
.c SDFStar .
Second, internally it can encapsulate an entire foreign domain
with a separate 
.c Galaxy
and a separate
.c Scheduler 
since it is derived from the
.c Wormhole
base class.
From the user point of view, a 
.c Wormhole
is merely a 
.c Galaxy
which contains 
.c Star s
of another domain ( refer to the manual, "\*(PT \fBPrimer\fR"
for more information on programs with
.c Wormhole s).
