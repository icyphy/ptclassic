.TI "The \*(PT Interpreter"
.AU
Joseph Buck
.AE
The \*(PT interpreter provides a textual interface for constructing
systems and performing simulations.
This interface is more convenient than the graphical interface
when large complex universes or being created automatically
by some other program.  It is also more convenient when using
a symbolic debugger to debug a new piece of code linked to \*(PT.
