.TI "The Old \*(PT Interpreter"
.AU
Joseph Buck
.AE
This document describes the old Ptolemy interpreter.  It is being
phased out, and will not be present in future releases.  There is
a new Ptolemy interpreter,
.i ptcl ,
based on the embeddable interpreter Tcl.
.pp
The \*(PT interpreter provides a textual interface for constructing
systems and performing simulations.
This interface is more convenient than the graphical interface
when large complex universes are being created automatically
by some other program.  It is also more convenient when using
a symbolic debugger to debug a new piece of code linked to \*(PT.
.pp
However, the old interpreter described in this document does not have
the control structures provided by the new
.i ptcl
interpreter, so it is less flexible.
