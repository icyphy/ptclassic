.H1 "Using Galaxies"
.pp
.IE galaxies
In this section we will explain how to create galaxies.  Galaxies allow
you to partition your design into more manageable pieces and to re-use
designs as components in other designs.
.H2 "Creating a Galaxy"
.pp
Let's use the schematic we created in the last example to make a sine wave
generator galaxy.
.BU
Instead of modifying our previous example, we will make a copy
of it.
In your ``example'' directory, type:
.(c
cp -r wave singen
.)c
The recursive copy, ``cp -r'', is necessary because Oct stores
data using a hierarchical directory structure.
Of course,
if the
facet singen exists already, you must remove it with ``rm -r''
first before copying.
.BU
Start Pigi.
.BU
Use \fIopen-palette\fP (or ``O'') to open the
``~ptolemy/lib/technology/ptolemy/system'' palette.
The system palette contains input and output ports which can be instantiated
into schematics just like stars.
.BU
Use \fIopen-facet\fP (or ``F'') to open the ``singen:schematic''
you created using ``cp -r''.
You must replace the default name ``untitled'' with ``singen''.
.BU
In the ``singen:schematic'' window, delete the Xgraph star and
the wire attached to it.
The easiest way to do this is draw a box (click-drag) around the
star and its input wire, press ``s'' to select these objects,
and then press ``D'' to delete them.
.BU
Place an output port where the Xgraph star used to be and connect
it to the output of the Sin star.
The output port is the icon in the system palette with an arrowhead.
.BU
Name the output port ``out'':
.LE
Position the cursor over the black box on the new output port.
.LE
Type "out" as a text argument, including quotation marks.
.LE
Type ``c'' for \fIcreate\fP.
Again, note that the \fIcreate\fP command has a different action
than before.  It names output terminals when given a text argument.
.BU
We now have a galaxy.  The fact that a schematic has input
or output ports distinguishes it as a galaxy.
.H2 "Using a galaxy"
.pp
We have just created a galaxy that we would like to use in another
design.  In order to do this, we need to create an icon for this galaxy
which we will then instantiate in our other design.
.BU
Create an icon:
.LE
Place cursor in ``singen:schematic'' window.
.LE
Execute \fImake-schem-icon\fP in the Pigi ``Extend'' menu (``@'').
.IE make-schem-icon
.LE
The dialog box should contain:
.(c
Palette:  ./user.pal
.)c
This specifies the name of the palette that will contain your icon.
By convention, we usually put galaxy icons in the palette called
``user.pal'' in the current directory.
Hence, this is the default name.
.LE
Click ``OK''.
Since you had already created an icon for the ``wave'' universe, and
that icon was copied by your ``cp -r'', VEM asks whether it is OK to
overwrite the icon.
Click ``OK''.
Wait until \fImake-schem-icon\fP is done.
VEM informs you that it is done with a message in the VEM console
window, which may be buried by now.
You must find it and bring it to the surface.
.BU
Open the palette called ``user.pal'' using \fIopen-palette\fP.  The
newly created galaxy icon should appear in this palette along with
a bright yellow dot called a \fBcursor\fP.  A \fBcursor\fP
.IE cursor
distinguishes a palette from other types of facets and it determines
where the next icon will be placed.
.BU
At this point, we have an icon for our sine wave generator
galaxy.  The icon for this galaxy is stored in an interface facet
called ``singen:schematic:interface''.  It is this icon facet
which is instantiated in the ``user'' palette.  We can now
use our sine generator galaxy simply by instantiating our
icon into another schematic.
.BU
Use \fIopen-facet\fP to create a new facet with the cell
name ``modulation''.
.BU
In the ``modulation:schematic'' window, create a universe which
takes two ``singen'' galaxies, multiplies their outputs together,
and then outputs the result using ``Xgraph''.
Unless the main ``sdf'' palette is already open, you'll probably
need to open it to create instances of the ``Xgraph'' and
``FloatProduct'' stars (the latter star is in the second row,
sixth from the left).
\fBHint\fR: If you place the icons so that their terminals
fall on top of one another, then a connection gets made without
having to draw a wire.
.BU
Now run the universe with the number of iterations set to 100.  The output
should appear as a squared sine wave, which is just an inverted
sine wave of twice the frequency shifted up by 1/2.
.pp
So far, we have created a galaxy and used it in another
universe.  But, we could also have used our galaxy within another
galaxy.  In this way, large systems can be broken up into smaller
more manageable pieces.
.H2 "Galaxy Parameters"
.pp
.IE "galaxy parameters"
One of the problems with the ``singen'' galaxy that we just created
is that it generates sine waves with a fixed frequency.  We would
like to make the frequency of the generator parameterizable.  That
way, we could set the two ``singen'' galaxies in our ``modulation''
universe to two different frequencies.
.pp
To make a galaxy parameterizable, we create \fBformal parameters\fP
in the galaxy and then link the formal parameters to the
\fBactual parameters\fP of the instances contained in the galaxy.  The terms,
formal and actual parameters, are analogous to formal and actual
parameters in any procedural programming language.  An example
will make this clear.
.BU
Create formal parameters:
.LE
Place the cursor in the ``singen:schematic'' window but away
from any instance,
i.e., in the grey background of the facet.
.LE
Execute \fIedit-params\fR and fill in the dialog as follows:
.(c
New name:  freq
New type:  float
New value:  PI/50
.)c
Then click on ``OK''.
Recall that you can use ``tab'' to move from one field to the next
of the dialog box and ``meta-return'' instead of ``OK''.
Hence, the dialog can be managed from the keyboard, without requiring
the mouse.
.IE "dialog boxes"
.LE
We just created a new formal parameter called ``freq'' with a
default value of ``PI/50''.  Additional parameters may be added or
old ones changed simply by invoking \fIedit-params\fP again.  Notice
that the action of \fIedit-params\fP changes depending on where the
cursor is.  If the cursor is over an instance, it edits the actual
parameters of that instance.  If no instance is under the cursor,
it edits formal parameters.
.BU
Link formal parameters to actual parameters:
.LE
Place the cursor over the ramp icon in ``singen:schematic''.
.LE
Execute \fIedit-params\fP and fill in the dialog as follows:
.(c
step:  freq
value:  0.0
.)c
This allows the ``freq'' parameter of a singen instance to control
the increment of the internal ramp star, thus controlling the
output frequency.
.LE
In earlier versions of Pigi, it was necessary, when adding a formal
parameter to a galaxy, to delete and recreate all instances of that
galaxy.  This is no longer required: all instances of the galaxy
that already existed will immediately ``know'' about the new parameter,
and will use the default value.
.BU
Change the frequency of one of the ``singen'' instances to
``PI/5'' by using \fIedit-params\fP.  This ``singen'' will be
ten times the frequency of the other.
.BU
Run the universe with an iteration of 100.  The output should
show the product of two sine waves with different frequencies.
Don't forget to save the facets we just created.
.BU
This is a good place to try out your own examples.  In general,
when you create new galaxies and universes that depend on each
other, it is a good idea to keep them together in one directory.
For example, all of the facets we have created so far are in the
``example'' directory.
.pp
An important note: whenever the contents of a galaxy are changed so that
the new definition has different I/O ports, the icon must be updated as
well.  You can do this by calling \fImake-schem-icon\fP again to replace
the old icon with a new one.
.IE "make-schem-icon"
VEM will not allow you to overwrite the old icon if you have instances
of the old icon in any open window (regardless of whether the window
is iconified).  Hence, you must either close those windows with
``control-d'' or delete the offending icon before replacing
it with a new icon.
