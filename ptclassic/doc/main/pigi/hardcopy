.H1 "Hardcopy"
.pp
The user has several options for printing graphs and schematics
developed under \*(PT.
.H2 "Printing Oct Facets"
.pp
A block diagram under pigi is stored as an Oct facet.
To print it to a postscript printer,
simply place the mouse anywhere in the facet and
invoke the "print facet" command from the "Other" pigi menu.
You must have the environment variable PRINTER set to point to
a valid postscript printer. You can do this, for example, with the command:
.(c
	setenv PRINTER \fIprintername\fP
.)c
A dialog box appears into which options may be entered.
The following options may prove useful:

-p     T{
Print in portrait mode, scaling to fit on the page or in the box
defined by the -b option.
T}
-l	T{
Print in landscape mode, scaling to fit on the page or in the
box defined by the -b option.
T}
-a	T{
Choose -l or -p, which ever gives the biggest plot (default).

inches on a side, use "-b 5x5".
