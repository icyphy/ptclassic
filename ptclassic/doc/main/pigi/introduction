This section contains all the information you need to run \*(PT using
the graphical interface.  If you are familiar with the X window system,
and your account is appropriately set up to run \*(PT,
then you may wish to skip directly to section 5 and begin running
\*(PT immediately.  You may need to occasionally refer to section 2 below
to understand some of the arcane terminology used.
