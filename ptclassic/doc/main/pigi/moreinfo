To find out more about Ptolemy and its capabilities, see the Almagest,
or complete Ptolemy
User's Manual [1].  This document is a part of that manual,
but may also be distributed or printed separately.
Pigi uses both VEM and Oct.  Reasonably complete VEM information is
included in the VEM section of the Almagest.
Further information can be found in the VEM manual [3].
Information about Oct is available in the Oct user's guide [4].
