.UH "Appendix A: Pigi Command Summary"
.pp
This appendix contains a list of all the \*(PT commands and a brief
description of what they do.
The next appendix summaries VEM commands.
To get the \*(PT menu, hold the shift button, and click the middle
mouse button.  The menu is sticky, in that it stays around after you
release the mouse button.  The first menu you see lists only
command categories.  The submenu is gotten by moving the mouse to
the arrow.  The submenus have the executable commands.
To the left of each command in the menu is the single key
accelerator used for that command.  These accelerators
are case sensitive.
.pp
To execute a command, click any
button again with the command highlighted.
To remove the menu without executing the command, click any button
with the mouse cursor somewhere away from the menu.
The commands below are grouped according to the submenus in which they appear.

Command	Key	Description

\fBEdit Menu:\fP
_
edit-params	e	T{
To edit the actual parameters of a star, galaxy, or
delay, place the cursor over the icon of the desired object.  To
edit the formal parameters of a galaxy or universe, place the cursor in a
window that contains the galaxy schematic and make sure the cursor
is not over any instance.
T}
.sp 0.5
define-params	+	T{
This command allows you to
change the list of formal parameters of a galaxy or universe,
as well as the type and value.  You can add or remove parameters from the list.
T}
.sp 0.5
edit-domain	d	T{
To specify the domain of a galaxy.
If the domain is different from the domain where the galaxy is used,
a wormhole will be automatically created.
All domains currently linked to pigi will be offered as options.
T}
.sp 0.5
edit-target	T	T{
To specify a target architecture for a code generation domain.
If no target architectures are defined for the current domain, an
error message will be issued.
T}
.sp 0.5
edit-comment	;	T{
Append a comment to a galaxy or universe.
For a galaxy, the comment will form the descriptor field for the
Other:profile command.
T}
.sp 0.5
edit-seed	#	T{
To specify the seed of the random number generation.
T}
.sp 0.5
find-name	\0	T{
Some error messages give the name of the offending instance of a block.
This command will cause that block to be highlighted, given its name.
T}
.sp 0.5
clear-marks		T{
Pigi tries to highlight objects when an error
occurs during compilation or execution, or when the find-name
command is invoked.  This clears the highlighting.
T}
=
\fBWindow Menu\fP
_
open-palette	O	T{
Open a palette from a list of palettes.
T}
.sp 0.5
open-facet	F	T{
Open an Oct facet.  A new window is created
displaying the facet.  Pigi commands can be executed from
this window.
T}
.sp 0.5
edit-icon	I	T{
Opens the facet containing the icon data for
the instance under the cursor.
T}
.sp 0.5
look-inside	i	T{
Opens the facet containing the schematic data
or the star definition for the instance under the cursor.

Command	Key	Description

\fBExec Menu:\fP
_
run	R	T{
Runs a universe.  Cursor must be inside a universe facet.
T}
.sp 0.5
re-run	!	T{
Runs a universe again
with the same parameters given on the
last \fIrun\fP.
T}
.sp 0.5
compile-facet		T{
Compiles the schematic which is under the
cursor.  The compile is recursive and so if the schematic
contains sub-galaxies, each sub-galaxy schematic gets compiled also.
Average users will not need this command.
T}
.sp 0.5
display-schedule		T{
Displays a parallel schedule if supported by the current Target.
T}
=
\fBExtend Menu:\fP
_
make-schem-icon	@	T{
Make an icon for the schematic under the cursor.
T}
.sp 0.5
make-star	*	T{
Make an icon for a new star.
T}
.sp 0.5
load-star	L	T{
Load the star pointed to by the cursor.
T}
.sp 0.5
load-star-perm	K	T{
Permanently load a star so that you can subsequently load
stars derived from it.
T}

\fBFilter Menu:\fP
_
equirriple FIR	<	T{
This is a provisional filter design capability, which simply
invokes a public domain Fortran program in its own window
for designing FIR filters using the Parks-McClellan algorithm.
More complete documentation is in the filter section of the Almagest.
Note that this program starts in your home directory, so filenames
should be given relative to the home directory.
T}
.sp 0.5
window FIR	>	T{
Like the equirriple FIR,
this is a provisional filter design capability, which simply
invokes a public domain Fortran program in its own window.
It designs FIR filters using the windowing technique.
More complete documentation is in the filter section of the Almagest.
Note that this program starts in your home directory, so filenames
should be given relative to the home directory.

plot Cx signal	-	T{
Plot real and imaginary parts of a complex signal.
T}
.sp 0.5
DFT	^	T{
Plot the discrete-time Fourier transform (magnitude and phase) of a signal,
as a function of normalized frequency.
T}
DFT of a Cx signal		T{
Plot the discrete-time Fourier transform (magnitude and phase) of a complex
signal, as a function of normalized frequency.
