.H1 "Setup"
.pp
This section explains how to configure a user to run Pigi.
It includes an explanation of environment variables that are
required, as well as enough information about the window system
for the novice user to get started.
.pp
When \*(PT is installed on your system, a
fictitious user named `ptolemy' is created.
This user is configured according to the tastes
of the authors of Ptolemy.
To configure your own account to behave the same way,
you can copy all the dot files from the directory ~ptolemy
into your home directory.
This behavior is explained below.
Unless you are a new user, however, you will probably not want to overwrite
features already defined in your own dot files.
In this case, you will need to extract the features you desire
from the dot files in ~ptolemy and add them to your own.
To make this easy to do, we explain below the salient features
of each of these files.
.H2 "Hosts"
.pp
Pigi runs as two separate processes, one of which is started using
.i rsh 
(remote shell).  In order for the second process to start properly, you
may need to have a file in your home directory called ``.rhosts''
with the line
.(c
machine_name user_name
.)c
where these names depend on who you are and what your machine is
called.  If rsh is not granted permission, you will receive an
uninformative message saying ``Permission denied.''  If you see this,
it means you must fix your .rhosts file.
.H2 "Environment Variables"
.pp
The most basic requirement
is that \*(PT executables be in your path.
.IE path
This should be done in your .cshrc file, rather than your .login file,
because RPC applications are started as separate processes,
and new processes do not examine the .login file.
.pp
The ~ptolemy/.cshrc file defines the path variable to include the appropriate
bin directories to run \*(PT.
.IE "cshrc file"
The pertinent lines read:
.EQ
delim off
.EN
.(c
if (! $?ARCH) setenv ARCH `/bin/arch`
set path = ( . ~ptolemy/bin ~ptolemy/bin.$ARCH ~octtools/bin $path )
.)c
The first of these lines sets your environment variable
.c ARCH
to the name of the type of machine you are running (e.g. sun3,
sun4, vax, or mips).
The second puts the \*(PT and Oct bin directories into your path.
If you add these lines to a previously existing .cshrc file,
be sure to put  these lines at the end of the file, after
any other directives that set the path variable.
.pp
If you plan to print out any \*(PT documents, you will need to set
the PRINTER environment variable.  In ~ptolemy/.cshrc the pertinent
line reads:
.(c
setenv PRINTER lw
.)c
You should replace
.c "lw"
with whatever printer name you are using.
.pp
If, for some reason, you wish to use an alternate version of the
.i pigiRpc
process, you will need to set your PIGIRPC environment variable
to the complete pathname of the executable file for the ``alternate
pigiRpc'' you wish to use (advanced users use this feature when
they want to, say, link in their own domains to Ptolemy).  This
variable must be set in your ``.cshrc'' or ``.profile'' to be
effective because of the way
.i vem
invokes
.i pigiRpc .
.H2 "The X Window System"
.pp
Pigi uses the X window system, version 11 release 4 (X11R4).
It will also run correctly under X11R3.
This section provides just enough information about using X
so that if you are not familiar with it you will nonetheless
be able to get started.
Complete documentation, however
would be helpful.
Complete guides to the X window system are
available in many technical bookstores.
If you are familiar with X, and your user account
is properly configured to run X11R4, you may skip
the rest of this section, proceeding directly to the \*(PT demos.
Pigi will automatically load the resources it needs
for operation.
If you wish to customize these resources, it may be useful
to scan this section.
Resources are explained below.
.H3 "Starting X"
.pp
At some installations, the X window server runs continually.
In our default installation, the server is
started explicitly by each workstation
user.  This permits a user to select a preferred window system.
The ``ptolemy'' user in the standard distribution
is configured under this latter model.
Unless the installer has modified it to conform with your installation,
then at the end of the file ~ptolemy/.login you will find the lines:
.IE "login file"
.(c
echo "To prevent X windows from coming up, type ^c now"
sleep 5
xinit -g +100+100 -iconic -fg white -bg black \\\\
        -title login -sb -sl 256 -C -e ~/.xinit
.)c
These lines start the X window system when you log in, unless you
type control-c before the sleep command finishes.
Some windows will open, together with an icon manager at the right
of the screen.
The number, size and location of the windows that are opened
are specified in the ~ptolemy/.xinit file, which reads:
.IE "xinit file"
.(c
#! /bin/csh -f
xrdb ~/.Xresources
xterm -geometry +0+0 -fn 9x15 -name "top left" &
xterm -geometry 80x40+0-0 -fn 9x15 -name "bottom left" &
xclock -geometry 120x120-0+0 &
twm &
/bin/csh
.)c
The second line reads X resources from the file ~/.Xresources.
The next three lines open windows using the xterm and xclock commands.
Then the window manager called ``twm'' is started.
The function of the mouse buttons is determined by
the ~ptolemy/.twmrc file.
This file is reasonably easy to interpret, even without any X experience,
so you may wish to examine it and customize it.
If your installation uses the X window system in some way that differs
from our default, then whoever installed \*(PT should have modified
the .login file above to reflect this.
.H3 "Manipulating Windows"
.pp
Assuming you use the file ~ptolemy/.twmrc without modification,
rather than your own window manager,
the basic window manipulations are explained below.
Note that there are often several different ways to accomplish the
same objective.  Feel free to experiment with key and mouse button
combinations in various parts of the screen.
First, you must identify the ``meta'' key on your keyboard.
It may be labeled in any of various ways, including ``meta'', ``left'',
``right'', ``alt'',  or any of a number of other possibilities.
It is usually close to the shift and control keys.
Most window manipulations require that you hold down the meta key
while depressing mouse buttons.
.UH "Iconifying windows."
.lp
Depressing the meta key, and clicking the left mouse button in any window
will iconify it.
The window disappears, replaced by a symbol in the icon manager at the right
of the screen.
To get the window back, place the cursor in the appropriate slot
of the icon manager, and click the left mouse button.
An alternative iconifying mechanism is to click any mouse button
on the icon symbol at the left of the window header.
.UH "Moving windows."
.lp
Holding the meta key and dragging with the middle mouse button will move
a window.  ``Dragging'' simply means to hold the mouse button while
moving the mouse.
Alternatively, you can drag the
left button in the middle of the window header.
.UH "Resizing windows."
.lp
The meta key and right mouse button can be used to resize a window.
Place the mouse cursor near a corner of a window, depress the meta key,
and drag the right button.
Alternatively, without the meta key,
any button in the rightmost corner of the window header will resize the window.
.UH "Mnemonic."
.lp
The window header has an iconify icon at the left, a blue bar for moving
the window in the middle, and a resize symbol at the right.
Correspondingly, without going to the window header, but using the meta key,
the left mouse button will iconify a window, the middle button will move it,
and the right button will resize it.  Hence, the window header can be used
as a mnemonic to help remember which mouse button has which function when
the meta key is depressed.
.UH "Pick up and stuff."
.lp
In a text window, without the meta key, the mouse may be used to grab text
and put it somewhere else,  either in the same window, or in some other window.
This can be very useful to avoid copying long sections of text.
The left mouse button, when depressed and dragged, highlights a region
of text in a window, and stores the text.
The right button can be used to modify the extent of the highlighted
region.
The highlighted text is "picked up", stored for future use.
The middle button causes the highlighted text to be typed
to whatever window has the mouse cursor.
.UH "New windows."
.lp
A useful command, defined in ~ptolemy/.cshrc, is ``term''.
Typing this in any window, followed by a carriage return,
opens a new terminal window with a reasonable size and color.
You may change the size and location in the usual way.
.UH "Removing windows."
.lp
Most windows, including all pigi windows,
can be removed by typing control-D with
the mouse cursor in the window.
.H3 "Resources"
.pp
A \fIresource\fR in X is a parameter 
.IE resource
that customizes the behavior of applications that run under X.
For instance, resources determine the foreground and background
color of your windows.
Pigi requires that some resources be set.
These resources are defined in the file ~ptolemy/lib/pigiXRes,
and are automatically merged with whatever other resources you may
have defined.
The merging occurs when you invoke the startup script ~ptolemy/bin/pigi.
In addition to these required resources, there are many optional resources.
Some of these are set in ~ptolemy/.Xresources.
.pp
If you have not used the X window system before,
you will probably not have a file with the name .Xresources in your home
directory, and can simply copy the one from ~ptolemy.
This file defines some basic resources.
If you already have a file with this name, then you can probably
use the one you have as is.
.pp
VEM can be extensively customized using resources.
Please see the VEM section of the Almagest for instructions.
.H3 "Running Pigi using Open Windows"
.pp
Pigi will run under Sun's Open Windows (which is based on a combination
of X11R4 and NeWS, another windowing protocol).  This document will
not attempt to teach you how to use Open Windows; there are excellent
tutorial documents available from Sun.  We'll assume as a starting
point that you are configured to run Open Windows;
.i "do not"
attempt to use the .login and .cshrc in the ptolemy account in
this case.  First, make sure that your .cshrc file defines the ARCH
environment variable as above.  Now add the
directories ``~ptolemy/bin'' and ``~ptolemy/bin.$ARCH'' to your
path, as described above.  You'll need to have the ``olwm'' window
manager run in the mode where focus follows the mouse (in this
mode, your keystrokes go to whatever window your mouse points to);
to do this, find the line in your .xinitrc file that invokes olwm;
add the option
.c -follow
to the olwm command.  If, for some reason, you must run olwm in the
click-to-focus mode, you must click the mouse in each window before
Pigi will accept keyboard commands in that window; it is possible
but annoying to use Pigi this way.
