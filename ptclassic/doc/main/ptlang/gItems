.H1 "Items that appear in galaxies"
.UH "Items that are the same as in defstar"
.pp
The following items, described above, take exactly the same
form in a
.c defgalaxy
as in a
.c defstar,
and hence need not be discussed further:
.(c
	name { }
	descriptor { }
	version { }
	author { }
	acknowledge { }
	copyright { }
	location { }
	explanation { }
	defstate { }
	constructor { }
	conscalls { }
	destructor { }
	start { }
	wrapup { }
	public { }
	protected { }
	private { }
	ccinclude { }
	hinclude { }
	code { }
	method { }
.)c
Other directives are necessary for constructing a galaxy, but these features
have not yet been implemented, so they cannot be discussed.
