The Ptolemy provides rich libraries of stars for each domain.
Since the stars in the libraries were designed as 
generic as possible, many complicated functions would be
realized by a galaxy of those stars.  Nonetheless, those stars
are not complete so that you may need to design your own stars.
For this purpose, the Ptolemy preprocessor language was devised.
The main part of this chapter is devoted to the usage of the
preprocessor language.  

The newly designed stars can be dynamically linked to the Ptolemy
when they are required, which avoids the hassle of frequent
recompilation of the system.  If the new stars are generic and
useful, however, it might be better to add them in the libraries and 
rebuild the system.  This chapter explains
what procedure should be followed to add or modify stars into the
libraries.
