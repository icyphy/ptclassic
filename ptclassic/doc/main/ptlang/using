.H1 "Using the preprocessor"
.pp
The language permits many star definitions to be written in one file;
processing the file results in one .cc file and one .h file for each
class.  This is not recommended.
.pp
The recommended procedure (the
.i required
procedure if you want Pigi's incremental linking and code viewing
features to work correctly) is to write the definition for a star in
domain XXX with name YYY in file XXXYYY.pl.  Then, running the command
.(c
        ptlang XXXYYY.pl
.)c
will produce the files XXXYYY.cc and XXXYYY.h, and makefiles can contain
the default rules
.(c
        .pt.cc:
                ptlang $<

        .pt.h:
                ptlang $<
.)c     
See the makefile in ~ptolemy/src/example or ~ptolemy/src/domains/sdf/stars
for how this can be made to work ``in context''.
