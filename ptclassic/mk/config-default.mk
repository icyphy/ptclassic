#
# Default configuration for Ptolemy builds.  Every Ptolemy makefile
# includes one of the config-xxx.mk files in this directory (where
# "xxx" might be "sun4" or "mips", for example).  Every such config file
# include this default config, and then selectively over-rides options
# defined here.  This is the master "definition" of all the makefile
# config variables, and the master documentation for what the variables
# mean.  The comments included here should *not* be duplicated into
# the other config files because then they become inconsistent and
# out of date.
#
# There are three groups of config variables: paths, options and programs
