# shared libraries interfere with incremental linking of stars.
# -Xlinker specifies that the next argument should be passed verbatim to

# -x requests that only global symbols be left in the executable.
# -S requests that the executable be stripped.
# It would see that these two conflict, but using just -x with the gnu
# linker results in a huge executable.
