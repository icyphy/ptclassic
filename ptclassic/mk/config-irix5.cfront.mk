# 
# (a) You have to make sure that the default $PTARCH is irix5.cfront 
#     rather than the plain irix5.  I did this by putting a patch 
#     into ~/.cshrc, which is where PTARCH is set from ~ptolemy/bin/ptarch. 
#     Thus, lines 12-16 .cshrc become:
#
#	# The arch script figures out what type of machine we are on.
#	if (! $?PTARCH) setenv PTARCH ` $PTOLEMY/bin/ptarch`
#	
#	# We want to use cfront - append .cfront suffix if not already there
#	setenv PTARCH `echo $PTARCH | sed -e "s/\..*//"`.cfront
#
#     You have to have the test because .cshrc is run many times with PTARCH 
#     already set, and you end up with ~/bin.irix5.cfront.cfront.cfront ...
#
# (b) Gnu make - must be the first `make' in $path.  I tried putting an 
#     alias in my .cshrc, but the make build invokes make under sh, which 
#     won't know the alias.
#
# (c) MATLAB - the install will automatically find your matlab libraries 
#     if it is installed on your system.  If you don't have matlab, you're 
#     OK (I assume).  However, if you do have matlab, the shipped libmat.a 
#     is not compiled with the special GOT-usage reducing flags, and it 
#     messes up the link of pigi.  The work around is to convert it into 
#     a shared object (linked at runtime) which works fine.  This is what 
#     I did (as root):
# 
#     cd /usr/tmp		# build here to avoid file locking problems
#     cp /usr/local/matlab/extern/lib/sgi/libmat.a .
#     ld -elf -shared -o libmat.so -all libmat.a           # creates libmat.so
#     cp libmat.so /usr/local/matlab/extern/lib/sgi/
#     ln -s /usr/local/matlab/extern/lib/sgi/libmat.so /usr/lib
#	# create symlink from /usr/lib so rld can find it - dumb of me
#
#    Then the pigi link automatically refers to the libmat.so in preference to 
#    linking in the libmat.a, and you're happy.

# for non-optimized compiles.

# MEMLOG    - Formerly used to log memory allocation and deallocation.
# WARNINGS  - Flags that print warnings.
# ARCHFLAGS - Architecture dependent flags, useful for determining which
#	      OS we are on.  Often of the form -DPTSOL2_4.
# LOCALCCFLAGS - Other architecture dependent flags that apply to all releases
#	      of the OS for this architecture for c++
# LOCALCFLAGS - Other architecture dependent flags that apply to all releases
#	      of the OS for this architecture for c++
# USERFLAGS - Ptolemy makefiles should never set this, but the user can set it.
