# |  Please note that Linux is moving to the ELF object file format, |
# |  but only some new distributions support it as of May 8,1995     |
# |  e.g.the Slackware distribution up to 2.2 does NOT support ELF   |
# --------------------------------------------------------------------
# Answer 'yes' if you have installed ELF tools (libc 5.0.x, binutils
#	2.5.2l.xx, libg++-2.6.2.4, ELF gcc 2.6.3 or later), even if
#	you compile in a.out format !
#
HAVE_ELF=yes
#
# We use ELF.
#
USE_ELF=yes
#
# We use a.out.
#USE_ELF=no
