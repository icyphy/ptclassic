# In config-$PTARCH.mk, we set the following variables.  We need to 
# use only the following variables so that we can use them elsewhere, say
# for non-optimized compiles.
# OPTIMIZER - The setting for the optimizer, usually -O2.
# MEMLOG    - Formerly used to log memory allocation and deallocation.
# WARNINGS  - Flags that print warnings.
# ARCHFLAGS - Architecture dependent flags, useful for determining which
#	      OS we are on.  Often of the form -DPTSOL2_4.
# LOCALCCFLAGS - Other architecture dependent flags that apply to all releases
#	      of the OS for this architecture for c++
# LOCALCFLAGS - Other architecture dependent flags that apply to all releases
#	      of the OS for this architecture for c++
# USERFLAGS - Ptolemy makefiles should never set this, but the user can set it.
