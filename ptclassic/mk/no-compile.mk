# This makefile is to be included if we don't need the compiler
# and we don't need to generate any dependencies.  Please don't use
# GNU make extensions in this file, such as 'ifdef'.
#
# The primary difference between a makefile that uses compile.mk and one
# that uses no-compile.mk is that in a directory that uses
# no-compile.mk, all the 'work' is done by make sources, and the make
# all command usually does nothing.
# 
# Another difference is that no-compile.mk should probably never appear
# in a make.template, since if there is a make.template, then we are
# calculating dependencies on the fly and creating a makefile, which
# probably means that we are compiling.

# Provide an initial value for LIB_DEBUG so we don't get messages about
# multiply defined rules for $(LIB)/$(LIB_DEBUG) if LIB_DEBUG is empty.
LIBR_DEBUG =	libdummy_g
