# If we are building on the irix5, build octtools libraries as shared
# libraries.  If octtools is built as static libraries, then the GOT will
# overflow when linking a full blown pigiRpc.  See the Irix dso man page for
# more information. 

# common.mk looks at this variable to decide how to build shared libraries
USE_SHARED_LIBS = yes
#USE_SHARED_LIBS = no

# Using GNU make conditionals causes havoc while bootstrapping gcc,
# so we don't use them here, however, this is what the code would look like

#ifeq ($(USE_SHARED_LIBS),yes) 
# Use Position Independent Code to build shared libraries
# Octtools/Xpackages/rpc requires PIC instead of pic

# libcgstars.a requires PIC instead of pic
CC_SHAREDFLAGS =	-fPIC

# Fiendishly evil hack to get change the LIB from libfoo.a to libfoo.so
