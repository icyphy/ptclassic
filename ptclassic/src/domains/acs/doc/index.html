 <p>James Lundblad of the Ptolemy group is developing the ACS domain
with <a href="http://www.sanders.com">Sanders</a>, a Lockheed Martin company.

 <p>A key feature of the ACS domain is to make it easier to generate
different implementations of a simulation.  The ACS domain uses the
Corona/Core approach, which was created by Jose Pino and Tom Parks
while they were at UC Berkeley.  In the Corona/Core design, a star has
one Interface, named the Corona, and one or more implementations,
named Cores.

 <p>The ACS domain will help in automating the FPGA design process;
it will help in transforming an SDF graph into a reasonable FPGA
implementation.  Initially, an 
<A HREF="http://www.annapmicro.com">Annapolis Microsystems</A> Wildforce
board will be the target.

 <p>Sanders has a web page describing the project at:
<a href="http://www.sanders.com/adv_tech/aam.htm"><CODE>http://www.sanders.com/adv_tech/aam.htm</CODE></a>

The Adaptive Computing Systems (ACS) Domain uses a different style of
star than the rest of Ptolemy.  ACS splits a star into a single
interface (called a Corona), and one or more implementations, called
Cores.
