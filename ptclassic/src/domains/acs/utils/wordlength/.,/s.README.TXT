% WORDGUI - Wordlength design program. 
%
% Note: in the help below, quotes ("") are used to describe options. 
% Do not enter any quotes into the WORDGUI edit boxes, just enter the
% requested information.
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% First, fill in the Path and Design Name edit boxes:
%
% Path: Enter the full path name into this box (no "/" at the end)
%       (note: Unix style slashes, not DOS). (Note: should be automatically
%	filled in at startup)
%
% Design Name: Enter the design name into this box (no extensions). (Note:
%	should be automatically filled in at startup)
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Next, either Import or Load the design:
%
% Import: When Path and Design Name are valid, click this button to
%       bring in the design from Ptolemy (loses any previous work).
%
% Load: If this design was previously Imported, clicking the Load
%       button will restore any previous work done on the design.
%
% Save: Save all work done on this design. A subsequent Load in
%       another session will restore this work. Can be done at any time
%       after Import or Load.
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Next, fill in these various parameter edit boxes:
%
% Max. Wordlength: Enter the maximum wordlength to consider for any arc, or
%       use the provided default.
%
% Max. I/O Wordlength: Enter the maximum input/output wordlength to consider 
%       for memory interfaces, or use the provided default. NOTE: must be
%       less than or equal to Max Wordlength.
%
% Max. Num. FPGAs: Enter the maximum number of FPGAs to consider, or use
%       the provided default. NOTE: for this release, only 1 FPGA allowed.
%
% Board File: Enter the boardfile name. NOTE: for this release, the only
%       options are: "Unconstrained" or "Wildfire".
%       Enter Wildfire to build designs for the wildfire board.
%       Use Unconstrained for experimenting only.
%
% Granularity: Enter the granularity with which to consider wordlength options
%       (e.g. "1" to allow wordlengths 1,2,3,..., "4" to allow wordlengths
%       4,8,12,... etc. Larger granularities allow for faster design time
%       (but possibly suboptimal designs).
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Next, calculate the range and variance arc parameters needed for analysis:
%
% Calc Range: Once design is Imported, clicking this button will
%       calculate the min and max range for every arc in the flowgraph.
%
% Calc Var: Once the ranges are calculated, clicking this button will
%       calculate the variances scale factors for every arc in the
%       flowgraph.
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Next, choose the
%
% Var. Comb. Mode: Succesive clicks on this button cycle through mode
%         to use for multiple outputs when calculating the design variance.
%
%       "m" = Maximum. The maximum variance of any output is reported (the
%             default, and a good one to start with).
%
%       "mw" = Maximum, Weighted.  Same as 'm', except that the individual
%             variances are weighted before the maximum operation. The 
%             weights are stored in a row vector "varweights", which
%             defaults to all 1's (so the default behavior is the same as
%             for the 'm' option). The user can change the varweights 
%             row vector values in the Matlab command window if desired.
%            
%       "w" = Weighted. The individual variances are are weighted and then
%             added. The weights are stored in a row vector "varweights", 
%             which defaults to all 1's (so the default behavior is the same
%             as for the 'm' option). The user can change the varweights 
%             row vector values in the Matlab command window if desired.
%
%       "u" = Uncombined. The individual variances for each output are 
%             kept separate. (NOTE: not really well tested! Also, much
%             slower than other modes.)
%
%   NOTE: Before clicking this button, the user must have previously 
%   performed Calc. Var. or an error results.
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%Next, optionally calculate a lower bounding curve on cost/variances.
%  
% NOTE: This feature is not operational this release.
%
% Lower Bound: This will draw a curve representing a theoretical lower
%       bound on cost/variance combinations (which might or might not
%       be achievable).
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%Next, begin the actual wordlength design process.
%
% MCMC: Clicking on this performs a search for good wordlength combinations.
%       When the search ends, the best designs from this search and previous
%       searches are kept. The user may perform as many searches as desired,
%       generally stopping when the improvements are small. Clicking the 
%       Save button will save the results of all the searches to date,
%       (a subsequent Load will restore these results. The search parameters
%       have been adjusted so that reasonably short searches are performed.
%
% Clear Old Designs: Clicking on this button clears the results of previous
%       searches. Generally, the user should click this if some of the 
%       edit boxes have been changes (e.g. max wordlength, granularity etc)
%       and the user does not want to consider those previous results.
%
% To guide the next search, the user may adjust the following:
%
% Max Cost: Enter the maximum cost to consider in the edit box. The 
%       toggle button "Active/Inactive" controls whether or not this
%       constraint is used. Changing this parameter does not invalidate
%       any previous search results. This feature is useful for situations
%       when previous searches have not adequately expored low cost regions
%       of the search space.
%
% C/V Bound: When the toggle button "Active/Inactive" is set to Active,
%       an upper bound on the next search in terms of cost and variance is
%       used. The bound is derived by passing a polynomial through the 
%       current best set of designs, and the variance bound is multiplied
%       by the value in the Boundmult edit box. Initially, for the first 
%       few searches, it is best to set this feature to "Inactive", to
%       get a robust starting estimate of the lower bound. As the curve
%       startes to look smooth, this feature should be activated, to 
%       speed up the search process. The Boundmult value should typically be
%       slowly decreased to about 1.01 at a minimum. (The user can start 
%       out with a much higher value than the default if desired. Also,
%       the value can really be set to just about anything greater than
%       one in any order, but slowly decreasing it gives the best results
%       on designs tested so far.)
%
%       NOTE: The polynomial fitting method used in this release is
%       unsatisfactory and will be improved in the next release. (The 
%       problem is that it doesnt fit the typical lower bounds very well,
%       thus slowing down the searches.)
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%Next, select and generate the design for re-importation into PTOLEMY.
% 
% Selection: The user enters the design number to select into this edit box.
%       The selection is hilighted in the cost/variance plot window.
%       The user may reenter this parameters as many times as desired.
% %W% %G%
% Generate: The design last selected by the user is generated. 
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Block Diagram (optional)
%
% If the user has Simulink installed, then these buttons will draw a 
% helpful block diagram. (NOTE: the diagram is not really Simulink compatible,
% so it cannot be used with other Simulink simulations). The diagram that
% is generated contains the instance and node numbers of the design.
% The user can use all the graphical commands of Simulink to rearrange and
% save the drawing.
% 
% Open: Open a previously designed block diagram or create a new one.
%
% Clear: Clear the block diagram.
%
% Close: Save and close the block diagram.
%
% NOTE: design must have been previously Imported or Loaded.
% NOTE: This feature really for internal development and debug.
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Finally,
%
% Quit: Quit out of the WORDGUI tool. NOTE: dont forget to click
%       the SAVE button! WORDGUI may be restarted by typing "wordgui" in
%       the Matlab command window.
