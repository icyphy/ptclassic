# loadc50
# Bash script to load files with TI's DSK loader(dsk5l.exe)
# Uses xdos to run dsk5l.exe.  The person running it must be root to
# mount/unmount the dos partition.
# This script was tested on a machine running linux(red-hat 3.0.3 
# diistribution) with dosemu-0.63.1.33 installed.
# Written by Luis Gutierrez.

# User's home directory.
set homedir = /root

# User's dos partition.

# The root path of DOS drive where DSK files and DOS binaries are stored.
set dosroot = c:

# The DOS directory(relative to dosroot\)where the *.asm and *.dsk files 
# are stored. Replace the \ in the DOS path with \\.
set dsksrc = dsk\\src

# The DOS directory(relative to dosroot) where the DSK 
# executables(dsk5a.exe, dsk5l.exe) are stored.  
# Replace the \ in the DOS path with \\.

# The file used to temporarily save autoexec.emu
set autoexecsave = autoexec.bak

cd $dospartition
mv autoexec.emu $autoexecsave

# The text between the first xxxx and the second xxxx will be
# piped to unix2dos and will end up in autoexec.emu.
