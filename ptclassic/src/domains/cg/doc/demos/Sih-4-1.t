This demo allows the properties of the parallel scheduler to be
investigated, by providing a universe in which the runtimes of
stars, the number of processors, and the communication cost between
processors can be varied.
.pp
The problem, as presented by the default parameters, is to schedule
a collection of dataflow actors on three processors with a shared
bus connecting them.  Executing the demo causes a Gantt chart display
to appear, showing the partitioning of the actors onto the three
processors.  Clicking the left mouse button at various points in the
schedule causes the associated stars to be highlighted in the universe
palette (for details on how to use the Gantt chart display, see the
CG domain documentation).  After exiting from the Gantt chart display,
code is written to a separate file for each processor (here the "code"
is simply a sequence of comments written by the dummy CG stars).
.pp
It is interesting to explore the effects of varying the communication
costs, the number of processors, and the communication topology.
To do so, execute the
.i edit-target
command (type 'T').  A display of possible targets comes up.
Of the available options, only
.c sharedBus-CG
and
.c fullConnect-CG
will use the parallel scheduler, so select one of them and click on
``Ok''.  Next, a display of target parameters will appear.  The
interesting ones to vary are ``nprocs'', the number of processors,
and ``sendTime'', the communication cost.  Try using two or four
processors, for example.  Sometimes you will find that the scheduler
will not use all the processors.  For example, if you make the communication
cost very large, everything will be placed on one processor.  If the
communication cost is 1 (the default), and four processors are provided,
only three will be used.
