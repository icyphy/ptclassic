.H1 "Introduction"
.pp
The
.c CG
domain and derivative domains are used to generate code rather
than run simulations.
Only the derivative domains are of practical use for generating
code (and none are included in this release).
The stars in the
.c CG
domain itself can be thought of as ``comment generators''; they
are useful for testing and debugging schedulers and for little else.
The
.c CG
domain is intended as a model and a collection of base classes
for derivative domains.
This section, therefore, documents the common features and general
structure of all code generation domains.
.pp
The principle mechanism is to define
.c codeblock s
that are processed and written to a code file, which can then
be compiled or assembled.
These code blocks can be parsed and edited in ways that depend
on the target processor.  In the generic
.c CG
domain, no such editing occurs.
.pp
A key feature of code generation domains is the notion of a target
architecture.
Every application must have a user-specified target
architecture, selected from a set of targets supported
by the user-selected domain.
Every target architecture is derived from the base class
.c Target ,
and controls such operations as scheduling, compiling, assembling,
and downloading code.
Since it controls scheduling, multiprocessor architectures can be
supported with automated task partitioning and synchronization.
