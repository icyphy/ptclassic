.Id "telephone channel simulator"
A tone is passed through some processing which implements various
distortions on a telephone channel.
There are 7 controllable parameters:
.TS
center;
l.
noise
channel filter
second harmonic
third harmonic
frequency offset
phase jitter frequency
phase jitter amplitude
.TE
.PP
Noise is generated using the 
.c IIDGaussian
star,
which simply averages a number of uniform random numbers.
This is much less expensive than the Box-Muller approach,
which will produce better Gaussians.
The standard deviation of the noise is scaled by 
the value of the \fInoise\fR parameter.
The noise power is the square of that number.
.PP
Linear distortion is introduced by the
.c FIR
star labelled channel filter.
The \fIchannel filter\fR parameters requires the
coefficients of an FIR filter.
The default filter is a null filter,
which simply introduces time delay.
.PP
To introduce frequency offset and phase jitter, an analytic signal is produced.
Then the line signal is modulated by a complex exponential that shifts
its frequency and jitters its phase.
The \fIphase jitter frequency\fR parameter, when multiplied by the sampling
frequency, yields the frequency in Hertz of the phase jitter.
The \fIphase jitter amplitude\fR parameter, when multiplied by 180 degrees,
gives the peak phase jitter in degrees.
Both the \fIphase jitter frequency\fR and the \fIphase jitter amplitude\fR
parameters are inside the
.c Tone
star.
.PP
Nonlinear distortion is introduced by squaring and cubing the signal.
.UH BUGS:
The nonlinear distortion introduces DC components,
which do not accurately reflect the behavior of a telephone channel.
