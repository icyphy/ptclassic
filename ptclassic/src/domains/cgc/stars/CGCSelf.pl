	explanation {
This is a star for recursion.  At runtime, it appears to contain
a clone of the galaxy whose name is given by "recurGal".
That galaxy is supplied with the input particles and executed.
That galaxy may be one within which this instance of Self resides,
hence realizing recursion.
At compile time, this star appears to just be an atomic star.
