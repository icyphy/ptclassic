    desc { This a version of DEDynFork for integer portholes. See the description of DEDynFork.pl, where this star is derived from, for details. It was used for a proof of concept demo for DynBlock and that stuff. It is probably not too useful anywhere else, because the only data I can send to my dynamically created block is here their instancenumber. One should use some kind of derived "message" the have the chance for a real contents.}
