    the PortHoles needed for the dynamically created blocks.
    }
    explanation {
This is the base star for all stars which support a mutable system 
configuration. It is an abstract class, so it can't be instantiated. See the 
descriptions of its childs for further explanation.

The current limitations are:
A block which is to instantiate must not have multiportholes.

Creating a block dynamically is as follows:

Using some source code from "HOFBase::createBlock" I get a pointer to a newly created block. This block is instantiated and put in a list. The input 
and output portholes of that newly created block are looked for and  
approriate farsides for these portholes are created in "DEDynMerge" and 
"DEDynFork" using their "createPortHole()"-method. These portholes are 
connected afterwards. Once they are connected, the newly created portholes
are initialized. If "parameter_map" is not empty, the parameters in the new 
block are set. If it is empty, the "initialization()"-method sets the default 
values. The entire galaxy's connectivity is checked. The next actions here 
are checking for delayfreeloops and updating the porthole priorities. We have 
to take special care of source-stars in the dynamically created blocks. If 
there are any, we have to give them an inital event at the current time. That 
means, all source-stars derived from DERepeatStar give now out an initial event at the time of their creation (instead of time zero, when they don't exist).
Otherwise these source-stars would never give out any event. See the description
of DERepeatStar for details.

Deleting a block dynamically is as follows:

I get a unique identifier for a block to be deleted. This block is looked for 
in my list of currently existing blocks. I get a pointer to my deleteBlock from the list and remove that block from the list. Then, the eventqueue is checked 
for any events pointing to deleteblock. If any events are found, they are 
deleted from the eventqueue. Then I look for input and output of the 
deleteblock. I again check the eventqueue for any events which are scheduled 
to the farside of the deleteblock's output. Then I disconnect the portholes 
from their farside and delete their farside using "removePortHole()" in 
"DEDynMerge" and "DEDynFork", respectively. Next, I remove deleteblock from 
the galaxy's blocklist, where it was added to by "createBlock". 
Once removed there, I can delete it. The entire galaxy's connectivity is 
checked. The last actions here are checking for delayfreeloops and updating 
the porthole priorities.

Scanning the eventqueue is as follows:

Using "scanEventList()" and "scanGalaxyForContents()" I go down the block's 
hierarchy until I only deal with atomic elements ("stars"). For each star I 
check the current eventQueue for any pending pointer to it (CQScheduler) or for any pending pointer to any of its input-portholes (DEScheduler) using 
"deletePendingEventsOfStar", which should be self-exploratory.
