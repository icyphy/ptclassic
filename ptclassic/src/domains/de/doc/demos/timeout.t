Demonstrate the use of the Timeout star.
Every one time unit, a timer is set.  If after another 0.5 time units
have elapsed the timer is not cleared, an output is produced to indicate
that the timer has expired.  The signal that clears the timer is a
Poisson process with a mean interarrival time of one time unit.
Thus, the timer expires quite often.

The "expired" output events always lag the input 
"set" events by 0.5 time units.  But they are only produced if
the timer expires before a "clear" event arrives.
