Create one or more instances of the named block to produce the
required number of output stream(s).
This is implemented by replacing the SrcGr star with the example block
at setup time.
The replacement block(s) are connected as illustrated by the example
block that is connected.
Their parameters are determined by "parameter_map".

See the explanation for the

star, from which this is derived.
The only difference is that this star forces the number of inputs to zero.
It hides the input port and the example output port.
