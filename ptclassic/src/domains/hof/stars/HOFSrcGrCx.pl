defstar {
	name { SrcGrCx }
	domain { HOF }
	derivedFrom { MapGr }
	desc {
Create one or more instances of the named block to produce the
required number of output stream(s).  This is implemented by replacing
the SrcGrCx star with the named block at setup time.  The replacement
block(s) are connected as illustrated by the example block that is connected.
Their parameters are determined by "parameter_map".

	explanation {
See the explanation for MapGr star, from which this is derived.
The only difference is that this star forces the number of inputs to zero
and output datatype to complex.  It also hides the input ports and the
\fIinput_map\fR parameter.
