# Important!  Do not run this makefile while in ~ptolemy/src/domains.  Instead
# run in from ~ptolemy/obj.$ARCH/domains (through the symbolic link) -- that
# way a separate directory containing, say, Sun-3 and Sun-4 objects can be
# maintained.

# The EXPDOMAINS environment variable can be used to build experimental domains
# which are assumed to follow the same directory structure.
