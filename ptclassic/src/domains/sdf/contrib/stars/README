List of the new stars:
---------------------
CIIDGaussian    Complex IID Gaussian generator
Cfft**          Compute the complex fft
ErrCnt          Error Counter
ExpGen          Complex Exponential Generator
IntDiv          Integer Divide
MagSqr          Magnitude Squared
Modulus         Integer Modulus
PipeOut         Pipe outputs to shell command
PnGen           PN Generator
PowerEst        Power Estimator
PowerEstCx      Power Estimator
QPSK            1input QPSK mapper. Inputs are int 0/1
QPSK2           2input QPSK mapper. Inputs are int 0/1
Rfft**          Compute the fft of a real input, using the '2-channel trick'
SineGen         Sine Generator
TWTA*           model of TWTA
                TWTA amplifier is modelled by its transfer characteristic.  
                Data points for output backoff (dB) vs. input backoff (dB) and 
                phase (degree) vs. input backoff are supplied in three arrays.
                Then for each complex input sample the input back off is 
                computed, and linear interpolation/extrapolation is used to 
                find the phase and output amplitude, which is converted back 
                to a complex output sample.
VDecoder***     Viterbi Decoder
VEncoder***     Viterbi Encoder
Variance        Compute Mean and Variance

* Will not compile due to unusual math library calls for degree based sine
  functions.  Should be straightforward to convert to standard calls.
** Will not link due to use of non-standard complex class.
*** Cannot be dynamically linked as it requires Encoder/Decoder functions
    from Encoder.cc or Decoder.cc
