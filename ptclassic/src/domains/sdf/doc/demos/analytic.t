This system uses a ComplexFIR filter to reduce the sample rate
of a sinusoid by a factor of 8/5, and at the same time
produce a complex, analytic, signal.
The magnitude spectrum of the original sinusoid and the filtered
sinusoid are both displayed.
Note the shift in the peak of the spectrum due to the sample-rate
conversion.  Also note that the symmetry of the original spectrum
is lost in the filtered spectrum.
