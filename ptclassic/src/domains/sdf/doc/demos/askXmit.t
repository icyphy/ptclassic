An amplitude-shift keyed (ASK) signal is generated by
the "ask" galaxy on the left.
The modulation format is a simple, baseband, binary-antipodal signal
with a 100% excess bandwidth raised cosine pulse.
The sample rate is eight times the baud rate, as controlled by the
\fIdecimation\fR and \fIinterpolation\fR parameters of the pulse
shaping FIR filter.
.pp
The resulting signal is low-pass filtered and displayed.
