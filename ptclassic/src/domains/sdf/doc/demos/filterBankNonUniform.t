 The upper channel contains the lower frequencies $omega$ over $(0, 2/3 pi)$
and the lower channel contains the upper frequencies $omega$ over 
$(2/3 pi, pi)$.
 The gain after the adder on the output compensates for the
downsampling by 3 in the analysis bank of filters.
 The analysis/synthesis filters are taken from [1].
