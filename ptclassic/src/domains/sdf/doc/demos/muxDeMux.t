This system shows how to use the
.c Mux
and
.c DeMux
stars.
.Se Mux

.Ie "multiplex"
.Ie "demultiplex"
The control signal for each is generated by the
.c WaveForm
star.
A ramp is demultiplexed, so the first two signals displayed
are the two outputs of the demultiplexer.
The control signal is chosen to repeat the pattern "0 0 0 1 1 1 2 2 2",
so the first three ramp outputs go to the top demultiplexer output,
the next three go to the bottom demultiplexer output, and the final three
go nowhere.
When the value of the control signal exceeds the number of outputs,
then all outputs of the demultiplexer produce 0.0.
The first control signal is periodic with period 9 and the second is
periodic with period 6, so the overall control pattern has period 18.
