 A signal is generated by filtering white Gaussian noise and then modulating
it with a chirp (a sinusoid with steadily increasing frequency).

 Spectral estimates are repeatedly computed using the autocorrelation method,
and displayed using the Waterfall star.
 Note that in the display, the first plot shows a roughly baseband spectrum,
while in subsequent displays the spectrum is centered at successively higher
frequencies.
 Note also that hidden points are not displayed.
 This can be changed by altering the parameters of the Waterfall star.
