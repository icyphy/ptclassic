.TI "SDF Stars"
.pp
The source code for all standard SDF stars is
in ~ptolemy/src/domains/sdf/stars.
By "standard" we mean the stars that are owned by \*(PT.
Because of their large number, their icons are divided into
two palettes accessible through the pigi main menu.
The "main" palette is identified
as ~ptolemy/src/domains/sdf/icons/main.pal, and contains
the most commonly used SDF functions.
The "dsp" palette is identified
as ~ptolemy/src/domains/dsp/icons/dsp.pal, and contains
more esoteric and specialized signal processing functions.
In this section, all stars in both palettes are listed,
and the only distinction made between them is their "location".
