        desc {
A finite impulse response (FIR) filter with fixed-point capabilities.
The fixed-point coefficients are specified by the "taps" parameter.
The default coefficients give an 8th-order, linear phase lowpass filter.
To read coefficients from a file, replace the default coefficients
with "< fileName", preferably specifying a complete path.
Polyphase multirate filtering is also supported.

        explanation {
.pp
This star implements a finite-impulse response filter with multirate capability
.
.Id "filter, FIR"
.Id "FIR filter"
The default coefficients correspond to an eighth-order, equiripple,
linear-phase, lowpass filter.  The 3dB cutoff frequency is at approximately
1/3 of the Nyquist frequency.  To load the filter coefficients from a file,
simply replace the default coefficients with the string "<filename".
.pp
It is advisable to use an absolute path name as part of the file name,
especially if you are using the graphical interface.
This will allow the FIR filter to work as expected regardless of
the directory in which the ptolemy process actually runs.
It is best to use tilde characters in the filename to reference them to
the user's home directory.  This way, future file system reorganizations
will have minimal effect.
.pp
When the \fIdecimation\fP (\fIinterpolation\fP)
state is different from unity, the filter behaves exactly
as it were followed (preceded) by a DownSample (UpSample) star.
However, the implementation is much more efficient than
it would be using UpSample and DownSample stars;
a polyphase structure is used internally, thereby avoiding the
unnecessary memory locations and multiplication by zero.
Arbitrary sample rate conversions by rational factors can
be accomplished in this way.
.pp
To design a filter for a multirate system, simply assume that the
sample rate is the product of the interpolation parameter and
the input sample rate, or equivalently, the product of the decimation
parameter and the output sample rate.
.Ir "multirate filter design"
.Ir "filter design, multirate"
.Ir "filter, multirate"
In particular, considerable care must be taken to avoid aliasing.
Specifically, if the input sample rate is f,
then the filter stopband should begin before $f/2$.
If the interpolation ratio is $i$, then $f/2$ is a fraction $1/(2 i)$
of the sample rate at which you must design your filter.
.pp
The \fIdecimationPhase\fP parameter is somewhat subtle.
It is exactly equivalent the phase parameter of the DownSample star.
Its interpretation is as follows; when decimating,
samples are conceptually discarded (although a polyphase structure
does not actually compute the discarded samples).
If you are decimating by a factor of three, then you will select
one of every three outputs, with one of three possible phases.
When decimationPhase is zero (the default),
the latest (most recent) samples are the ones selected.
The decimationPhase must be strictly less than
the decimation ratio.
