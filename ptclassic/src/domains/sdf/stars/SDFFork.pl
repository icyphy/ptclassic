	explanation {
This star is generally used to connect a single output port
to multiple input ports.  It will be automatically inserted
when multiple inputs are connected to the same output using the graphical
interface, or when the "nodeconnect" command is used in the interpreter.
However, there are times when automatically inserted Fork stars
are not desirable.  For instance, when there is a delay on one
of the arcs, then the Fork must be inserted by the user explicitly
to avoid ambiguity about the location of the delay.
Also, when multi-portHoles are used, auto-forking can cause problems.
In this situation, one may get,
for example, two outputs and several inputs on the same net.
There is currently no way to automatically decipher what the user
intends.  Hence, the Fork star should be inserted explicitly.
