This demo generates code which specifies a full adder from individual
gates.  Note the use of Through stars inside the FULLADDER galaxy to
avoid fanning out signal lines directly connected to galaxy input
terminals.  The gate logic implements the sum result output and
carry-out output functions using 2-input and 3-input logic gates.
Similar methods can be used to build up multi-bit adders or
arithmetic-logic units as desired.  If these larger design units
become too unwieldy to draft by hand, then behaviorally-specified
designs can be used where the functions are accomplished in behavioral
VHDL code.
