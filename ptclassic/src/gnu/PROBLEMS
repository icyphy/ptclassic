src/gnu/PROBLEMS

This file contains pointers about different problems you may run
across during the installation of the GNU tools.

If you have problems with installing gcc, look at gcc/INSTALL.
Also, look at gcc/gcc.info-8, and search for Installation Problems.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

DEC

* On aniljain, the following compile fails in gnu/libio:
/users/ptdesign/obj.mips/gnu/gcc/xgcc -B/users/ptdesign/obj.mips/gnu/gcc/ -c -g -I. -I/users/ptdesign/src/gnu/src/libio -I/users/ptdesign/obj.mips/gnu/gcc/include filedoalloc.c

        It looks like problems with size_t.  I changed
	obj.mips/gnu/gcc/include/sys/types.h:  

	  /* Changed by cxh 1/14/93.  size_t was being undefined during the
	     libio build, so we comment out these the _POSIX_SOURCE lines
	   */
	  /*#if !defined(_POSIX_SOURCE) || defined(_XOPEN_SOURCE) commented out
            by cxh*/
	  #ifndef	_SIZE_T_
          #define	_SIZE_T_
          #ifndef _GCC_SIZE_T
          #define _GCC_SIZE_T
          typedef unsigned int size_t;
          #endif
          /* #endif commented out by cxh*/	/* _SIZE_T_ */


make/main.c fails to compile
----------------------------
	If you already have gcc installed and main.c is compiled with
	cc, which results in errors, then it could be that configure
	got confused.  You could try building make CC set to gcc
		make CC=/usr/local/gnu/bin/gcc
	You should use the full pathname of gcc if you attempt to
	compile gcc with a make CC=.  Otherwise make could become
	confused. 

	On hp, you can reconfigure the make directory with:
	cd $PTOLEMY/obj.hppa/gnu/make
	$PTOLEMY/src/gnu/src/make/configure hppa1.1-hp-hpux -v --srcdir=$PTOLEMY/src/gnu/src/make --prefix=$PTOLEMY/gnu/common --exec-prefix=$PTOLEMY/gnu/hppa 
alloca undefined symbol in make build
-------------------------------------
	On the hppa, building with gcc may result in an error message
	about alloca being undefined
	Try building with:
	cd $PTOLEMY/obj.hppa/gnu/make
	make ALLOCA=alloca.o

SGI
---
	When building on the SGI under irix4, try:
	cd $PTOLEMY
	make -k bootstrap 

	Under IRIX5.2, you may get an error message like:
	>(cd /users/ptdesign/obj.irix5/gnu; make MAKE=`if [ -f /users/ptdesign/obj.irix5/gnu/make/make ]; \
	> then echo /users/ptdesign/obj.irix5/gnu/make/make ; \
	> else echo make; fi` )
	>Missing ]
	>*** Error code 1 (bu21)
	If you do, try:

	cd $PTOLEMY/obj.$PTARCH/gnu; make

	You may still need to do:
	cd $PTOLEMY/obj.$PTARCH/gnu/make; make ALLOCA=alloca.o

	This should solve the alloca problems in building cccp:
	cd $PTOLEMY/obj.$PTARCH/gnu; make/make CC="cc -Wf,-XNh1500,-XNg1500 -Olimit 3000 -cckr -O1"

	Note that under IRIX5 gcc -g does not work.  The SGI apps faq says:

	- gcc's '-g' option (include debugging info) does not work on IRIX 5.x.
	  This is not a bug, but an absence of support. '-g' will work when
	  someone ports GNU's 'gas' to IRIX 5.x or explicitly writes ELF
	  support into gcc.
