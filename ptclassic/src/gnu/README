src/gnu/README

This directory tree contains the source to GNU software necessary to
build Ptolemy from scratch. 

Note that the binary Ptolemy distributions include the GNU binaries
produced by the sources in this directory.  You need not reinstall the
GNU binaries from this directory if you already have the Ptolemy
binary distribution.

If you plan on doing dynamic linking with the prebuilt binary
distribution, you will need to have gcc available.

Note that the tcl/tk source is elsewhere.

This directory contains the following GNU tools
	egcs-1.0.2
	make-3.76.1

If you obtained the hp GNU tar file, then you should also have:
        binutils-2.8.1
	bison-1.25
	flex-2.5.4

The makefile in this directory has only been tested with Solaris2.5.1
and HPUX10.20.  It may work on other platforms, but we have
not tried.

Versions
--------
	In general, you are better off using the versions above.
	gcc-2.8.0 has problems, see $PTOLEMY/doc/release.html
	gcc-2.7.2.2 should work, but has not been tested extensively.

	Ptolemy is not very sensitive to the version of GNU make.  Any
	recent version of GNU make should work.  

GNU make
--------

	You must use GNU make to compile Ptolemy, there are GNU make
	extensions in some of the makefiles.

	The 'clean' rules in the following makefiles cause problems with
	SunOS4.1.3 make:
		mk/common.mk, src/vem/vem/makefile

	The 'all' rule in the following makefile causes problems with
	SunOS4.1.3 make:
		 src/vem/vem-bin.mk

	src/domains/cg56/targets/makefile and mk/stars.mk contain a
	makefile conditional dependent on S56DIR.  GNU make has
	makefile conditionals, Sun make does not.

	src/vem/vem/makefile depends on the $(@D) and $(@F) GNU make
	directives. 

	mk/common.mk, mk/config-sol2.mk and mk/config-sol2.cfront.mk
	all have a makefile conditional that checks the value of
	$(USE_SHARED_LIBS).
	
HP
--
	egcs needs the GNU assembler, gas, for the gcc -g option.
	See gcc/INSTALL for details.

	HPUX10.20 comes with a broken version of cc that is sufficient
	to bootstrap gcc.

	* If you are using the unbundled ansi-C compiler you should
	probably check http://us-support.external.hp.com/ for patches.
        In a vanilla HPUX-10.20 installation, we installed
	PHSS_9855 - s700_800 10.X HP C++ (A.10.24) with a correct eh/lib++.a
	PHSS_9400 - s700_800 10.20 ld(1) cumulative patch
	PHSS_9927 - s700_800 10.X ANSI C compiler cumulative patch
	PHKL_8693 - s700 10.20 sys/time.h fix for select(2)/C++ defects


	* To install gcc under HPUX10.20, you need to have GNU sed,
	If you don't use GNU sed, then fixincludes will fail under
	HPUX10.20 with some unterminated #if - #endif pairs.

	GNU sed is available from:
	http://hpux.csc.liv.ac.uk/hppd/hpux/Gnu/alpha.html
	You can also find the sed binary on the Ptolemy ftp site
	at
	ftp://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/pub/gnu/hppa/sed-2.05-sa-10.10.depot

	Install the package by downloading the file, copying it to
	/tmp and doing the following as root:
	swinstall -s /tmp/sed-2.05-sa-10.10.depot
	
	If you have problems with swinstall, try ungzipping the file
	first:
	mv /tmp/sed-2.05-sa-10.10.depot /tmp/sed-2.05-sa-10.10.depot.gz
	gunzip /tmp/sed-2.05-sa-10.10.depot.gz
	Then try swinstall as above.

	The install procedure will install the sed binary into
	/opt/sed/bin.  You might want to make a link from
	/usr/local/bin/sed to /opt/sed/bin

	cd /usr/local/bin
	ln -s /opt/sed/bin/sed .

	To verify that the proper sed is in your path, do:
	ptuser@hewlett 19% sed -V
	GNU sed version 2.05

Solaris
-------
	Solaris2.x does not come with a working compiler.  The
	compiler at /usr/ucb/cc should be avoided at all costs.

	If you don't have a working compiler under Solaris, you can
	download one from ftp://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/pub/gnu

	If the prebuilt compiler on the ftp site is not based on the
	the same release of the OS that you are running, you can use
	the prebuilt compiler to bootstrap build a compiler for your
	current release.  Download the prebuilt compiler, and do
	'gcc -v' to see what version of the OS the compiler was built
	with.

	In this case, the compiler was built with solaris2.5.1:
cxh@carson 57% gcc -v
Reading specs from /users/ptdesign/gnu/sol2.5/lib/gcc-lib/sparc-sun-solaris2.5.1/egcs-2.90.27/specs
gcc version egcs-2.90.27 980315 (egcs-1.0.2 release)
cxh@carson 58% 

	If you see messages like:
	Usage: ln [-f] [-s] f1
	       ln [-f] [-s] f1 f2
	       ln [-f] [-s] f1 ... fn d1

	The fix is to place /bin in your path before /usr/ucb, and 
	then run:
	     cd $PTOLEMY/src/gnu; make bin_libg++ install

	If, while trying to configure make, you get:

checking whether setvbuf arguments are reversed... configure: error: can not run test program while cross compiling

	then check to so if your 'cc' is /usr/ucb/cc.  If it is, and you 
	have gcc, then do:
		cd $PTOLEMY/bin.$PTARCH
		ln -s gcc cc
	If you don't have gcc, then you can try getting a prebuilt binary
	from ftp://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/pub/gnu.  You can then rebuild
	if necessary.

Linux
-----
	If you are trying to build GNU with this makefile, you may need
	to modify LIBGPLUSPLUS_VERSION.

DEC Alpha
---------
	If you are trying to build gcc-2.7.2 under OSF3.2, you may
	need to modify $PTOLEMY/src/gnu/src/gcc/config/alpha/x-alpha
	and add -lots to CLIB:
		CLIB=-lots -lmld 
	If you, then while you are compiling collect2, you may see
	messages like:
		Unresolved:
		_OtsRemainder32Unsigned


	If you try to configure gcc or itcl and get messages like:
		configure: error: can not find sources in 
			--srcdir=/users/ptolemy/src/tcltk/itcl2.2 

	The problem is that gnu sed has problems, below is an example:

	218% echo "--srcdir=bar" | sed -e 's/[-_a-zA-Z0-9]*=//' 
	--srcdir=bar
	219% which sed
	/usr/sww/bin/GNU/sed
	220% echo "--srcdir=bar" | /usr/bin/sed -e 's/[-_a-zA-Z0-9]*=//' 
	bar

	The fix is to put /usr/bin in your path before GNU sed


	While trying to build GNU make 3.75 under OSF1 V4.0, read.c failed
	to compile:
	
cc: Error: read.c, line 2135: In this statement, "GLOB_ALTDIRFUNC" is not declared.
	switch (glob (old->name, GLOB_NOCHECK|GLOB_ALTDIRFUNC, NULL, &gl))
	
	The fix is to do
	
	cd $PTOLEMY/obj.$PTARCH/gnu/make
	make CC="cc -D_BSD_SOURCE"

gcc and Purify
--------------
	To use Purelink and Purify from Pure Inc, be sure to build gcc
	with out the GNU assembler, gas.  Also, be sure to use
	ld-collect rather than GNU ld.  In this directory, we
	configure gcc to not use gas and not to use GNU ld.  


How to Install
--------------
	The top level PTOLEMY makefile contains a target called
	'install_gnu' which will install the GNU tools for you.

	Note that libg++ requires that gcc be installed before
	compiling libg++.  It is possible to use a link for gcc, see
	src/libg++/libg++/README

	1. Set your PTARCH and PTOLEMY environment variables:
		setenv PTARCH sol2
		setenv PTOLEMY /users/ptolemy

	2. Set your path:
		set path = ($PTOLEMY/bin.sol2 $PTOLEMY/bin $path)
	Note that if you are running Solaris2.x	then you will need to
 	have /bin in your path before /usr/ucb 
	(See the Solaris section above).
	
	3. Do the build:
		cd $PTOLEMY
		make install_gnu

	The contents of the src/gnu and obj/gnu directories may be
	removed after installation.
