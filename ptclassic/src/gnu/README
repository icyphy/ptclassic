src/gnu/README

This directory tree contains the source to GNU software necessary to
build Ptolemy from scratch. 

Note that the binary Ptolemy distributions include the GNU binaries
produced by the sources in this directory.  You need not reinstall the
GNU binaries from this directory if you already have the Ptolemy
binary distribution.

If you plan on doing dynamic linking with the prebuilt binary
distribution, you will need to have gcc available.

Note that the tcl/tk source is elsewhere.

This directory contains the following GNU tools
	gcc-2.7.2.2
	libg++-2.7.2
	make-3.75

If you obtained the hp GNU tar file, then you should also have:
	binutils-2.7
	bison-1.25
	flex-2.5.4

makeinfo, the GNU documentation program is not currently part of the
Ptolemy GNU binary distribution.

makeinfo is part of the texinfo package.  texinfo is available via
anonymous ftp at ftp.uu.net in packages/gnu.

The makefile in this directory has only been tested with Solaris2.4,
SunOS4.1.3 and HPUX10.01.  It may work on other platforms, but we have
not tried.

Versions
--------
	Ptolemy is particularly sensitive to the version of libg++.
	Versions earlier than libg++-2.5.2 may work, but your are own
	your own.  

	libg++-2.5.2 has a bug showed up in the sun4.opt build when we
	compiled pigiRpc with the -O option.  The problem was an
	unknown symbol __vt$7istream$3ios during link time.  This
	symbol comes from kernel/Tokenizer.cc.  Other than that, we
	use libg++-2.5.2 on site for about a month with no problem.
	For the 0.5 release, we upgraded to libg++-2.5.3.

	The 0.5.2 release was under gcc-2.6.3

	Ptolemy is not very sensitive to the version of GNU make.  Any
	recent version of GNU make should work.  

GNU make
--------

	You must use GNU make to compile Ptolemy, there are GNU make
	extensions in some of the makefiles.

	The 'clean' rules in the following makefiles cause problems with
	SunOS4.1.3 make:
		mk/common.mk, src/vem/vem/makefile

	The 'all' rule in the following makefile causes problems with
	SunOS4.1.3 make:
		 src/vem/vem-bin.mk

	src/domains/cg56/targets/makefile and mk/stars.mk contain a
	makefile conditional dependent on S56DIR.  GNU make has
	makefile conditionals, Sun make does not.

	src/vem/vem/makefile depends on the $(@D) and $(@F) GNU make
	directives. 

	mk/common.mk, mk/config-sol2.mk and mk/config-sol2.cfront.mk
	all have a makefile conditional that checks the value of
	$(USE_SHARED_LIBS).
	
HP
--
	gcc-2.7.2 needs the GNU assembler, gas, for the gcc -g option.
	See gcc/INSTALL for details.

	HPUX10.01 comes with a broken version of cc that is sufficient
	to bootstrap gcc.

Solaris
-------
	Solaris2.x does not come with a working compiler.  The
	compiler at /usr/ucb/cc should be avoided at all costs.

	If you don't have a working compiler under Solaris, you can
	download one from ftp://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/pub/gnu

	If the prebuilt compiler on the ftp site is not based on the
	the same release of the OS that you are running, you can use
	the prebuilt compiler to bootstrap build a compiler for your
	current release.  Download the prebuilt compiler, and do
	'gcc -v' to see what version of the OS the compiler was built
	with.

	In this case, the compiler was built with solaris2.4
	cxh@watson 80% gcc -v
	Reading specs from /users/ptdesign/gnu/sol2/lib/gcc-lib/sparc-sun-solaris2.4/2.7.2/specs
	gcc version 2.7.2
	cxh@watson 81% 

	Under solaris libg++-2.7.1 has a bug where /usr/ucb/ln will
	fail:

	gcc -h libstdc++.so.2.7.1 -shared -o libstdc++.so.2.7.1 `cat piclist` -lm
	ln -sf libstdc++.so.2.7.1 libstdc++.so
	Usage: ln [-f] [-s] f1
	       ln [-f] [-s] f1 f2
	       ln [-f] [-s] f1 ... fn d1

	The fix is to place /bin in your path before /usr/ucb.  This
	bug will probably be fixed in the next release of libg++


	If, while trying to configure make, you get:

checking whether setvbuf arguments are reversed... configure: error: can not run test program while cross compiling

	then check to so if your 'cc' is /usr/ucb/cc.  If it is, and you 
	have gcc, then do:
		cd $PTOLEMY/bin.$PTARCH
		ln -s gcc cc
	If you don't have gcc, then you can try getting a prebuilt binary
	from ftp://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/pub/gnu.  You can then rebuild
	if necessary.

SunOS4.1.3
----------
	While trying to install libg++-2.7.2:
		gcc -fpic -shared -o libstdc++.so.2.7.2 `cat piclist` 
		collect2: ld returned 4 exit status
		ld: ../libiberty/pic/strtoul.o: can't mix pic and PIC .o
	The fix we did in the sources was to edit libg++/config/mt-sparcpic
	and change -fpic to -fPIC.

	libg++/config/ChangeLog says:
	> Thu Feb 15 13:07:43 1996  Ian Lance Taylor  <ian@cygnus.com>
	> [...]
	> * mh-sparcpic (PICFLAG): Set to -fPIC, not -fpic.

	This problem is new in libg++-2.7.2.  Ptolemy0.6 was shipped with
	libg++-2.7.1


Linux
-----
	If you are trying to build GNU with this makefile, you may need
	to modify LIBGPLUSPLUS_VERSION.

DEC Alpha
---------
	If you are trying to build gcc-2.7.2 under OSF3.2, you may
	need to modify $PTOLEMY/src/gnu/src/gcc/config/alpha/x-alpha
	and add -lots to CLIB:
		CLIB=-lots -lmld 
	If you, then while you are compiling collect2, you may see
	messages like:
		Unresolved:
		_OtsRemainder32Unsigned

gcc and Purify
--------------
	To use Purelink and Purify from Pure Inc, be sure to build gcc
	with out the GNU assembler, gas.  Also, be sure to use
	ld-collect rather than GNU ld.  In this directory, we
	configure gcc to not use gas and not to use GNU ld.  


How to Install
--------------
	The top level PTOLEMY makefile contains a target called
	'install_gnu' which will install the GNU tools for you.

	Note that libg++ requires that gcc be installed before
	compiling libg++.  It is possible to use a link for gcc, see
	src/libg++/libg++/README

	1. Set your PTARCH and PTOLEMY environment variables:
		setenv PTARCH sol2
		setenv PTOLEMY /users/ptolemy

	2. Set your path:
		set path = ($PTOLEMY/bin.sol2 $PTOLEMY/bin $path)
	Note that if you are running Solaris2.x and compiling libg++-2.7.1
	then you will need to have /bin in your path before /usr/ucb
	(See the Solaris section above).
	
	3. Do the build:
		cd $PTOLEMY
		make install_gnu

	The contents of the src/gnu and obj/gnu directories may be
	removed after installation.
