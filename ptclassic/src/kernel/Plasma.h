 Programmer:  J. Buck
 Date of creation: 10/31/90
 Revisions:
	The original version of Plasma was by D. Messerschmitt and
	E. A. Lee.  This version has been modified considerably; it
	is derived from ParticleStack, which uses members of the
	Particles themselves to form a stack.

A Plasma is a collection of currently unused Particles

Particles no longer needed are added to the Plasma; any
OutPortHoles needing a Particle gets it from the Plasma

There is precisely one global instance of Plasma for each
Particle type needed -- this common pool makes more
efficient use of memory.  The static member plasmaList
is a list of all global Plasmas.  Each global Plasma is a
node on the linked list plasmaList.

There may also be any number of local Plasmas of each type, which
permit separate pools to be used for a given subsystem.  When a
local Plasma runs out of particles, it obtains them from the
corresponding global Plasma.  The advantage of local Plasmas
is for multithreading: if both ends of the local Plasma are in
the same thread, no lock is needed.
