This is a Particle class that contains StringMessages (accessed via
Envelopes). The class exists in order to make String messages
"first-class" datatypes.

I consider this a temporary measure until we can rationalise the
way Message particles work. This class inherits from Particle
(duplicating a lot of code in MessageParticle) just so I don't
have to change MessageParticle (by making member functions virtual).
