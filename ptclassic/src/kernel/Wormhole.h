 @(#)Wormhole.h	2.20		07/17/97

	The Wormhole class is defined in this file.
	A Wormhole is a Star with a component Galaxy
	and a Target to fire the blocks in the Galaxy.
	To the outside, a Wormhole behaves exactly like 
	a Star of the outside domain, although the Galaxy encapsulated
	in the Wormhole may be of a different domain.

	A Wormhole differs from a Universe in that it needs an
	interface between the inside and outside domains, which are
	often totally different. 

	The Wormhole class is intended to be used as a "mix-in"
	class with XXXStar to derive XXXWormhole.  The derivation
	graph of Wormhole is:
	Runnable -->   Wormhole --> SDFWormhole <-- SDFStar
		 		--> DEWormhole  <-- DEStar
		 		--> XXXWormhole  <-- XXXStar
