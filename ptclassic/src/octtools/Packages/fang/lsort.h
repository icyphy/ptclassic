/*
 *  'Generic' linked-list sorting 'package'
 *
 *  Use:
 *	#define TYPE		the linked-list type (usually a struct)
 *	#define NEXT		'next' field name in the linked-list structure
 *	#define SORT		sorting routine (see below)
 *
 *  Optional:
 *	#define DECL_SORT	'static' or undefined
 *	#define DECL_SORT1	'static' or undefined
 *	#define SORT1		sorting routine (see below)
 *	#define FIELD		select a subfield of the structure for the
 *				   compare function (default is to pass
 *				   a pointer to the structure)
 *	#include "lsort.h"
 *
 *  This defines up to two routines:
 *	SORT1(TYPE *list, int (*compare)(TYPE *x, TYPE *y))
 *	    sort the linked list 'list' according to the compare function
 *	    'compare'
 *
 *	SORT(TYPE *list, int (*compare)(TYPE *x, TYPE *y), int length)
 *	    sort the linked list 'list' according to the compare function
 *	    'compare'.  length is the length of the linked list.
 *
 *  Both routines gracefully handle length == 0 (in which case, list == 0 
 *  is also allowed).
 *
 *  By default, both routines are declared 'static'.  This can be changed
 *  using '#define DECL_SORT' or '#define DECL_SORT1'.
 *
 *  If field is used, then a pointer to the particular field is passed
 *  to the comparison function (rather than a TYPE *).
