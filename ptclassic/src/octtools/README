octtools/README

This directory contains the source to the subset of octtools used by
Ptolemy.  Primarily, Ptolemy uses vem.  A few tools that handle
Octtools facets are also included.

The source was taken from Octtools 8.2 and converted over to Ptolemy
Style makefiles.

The main differences between vem from 8.1 and vem from 8.2:
	* vem-8.2 does not use rsh, so pigi need not be able to rsh.
	This saves a lot of grief with .rhosts files.
	* vem-8.2 is somewhat more distributable than 8.1, 8.2 is not
        encumbered by a restrictive distribution policy.  See
        COPYRIGHT for more information

How to debug Ptolemy/vem problems
---------------------------------

    $PTOLEMY/octtools/bin.$PTARCH should contain two binaries, vem and
    vem.debug.

    I've modified the pigiEnv.csh script so that you can determinie
    which vem is run by setting an environment variable, VEMBINARY.

    Usually pigiEnv.csh will run $PTOLEMY/bin.$PTARCH/vem.  
    To run a debug version of vem, set the VEMBINARY variable with:

	setenv VEMBINARY $PTOLEMY/octtools/bin.$PTARCH/vem.debug
    
    And then start up pigi.

    Formerly a binary had to be named 'vem' to get the proper
    bindings.  I believe that this is no longer a problem.  If you do
    have problems with bindings, try making a private link from
    from vem to vem.debug:
	cd ~/bin
	ln -s $PTOLEMY/octtools/bin.$PTARCH/vem.debug vem
    
    The vem 8.1 binaries are available as:
    	setenv VEMBINARY $PTOLEMY/octtools/bin.$PTARCH/vem-8.1
    and
	setenv VEMBINARY $PTOLEMY/octtools/bin.$PTARCH/vem-8.1.debug

    Looking at core files
    ---------------------
    If you create a core file with vem.debug, use gdb to get a
    backtrace:

	gdb $PTOLEMY/octtools/bin.$PTARCH/vem.debug core

    You may find it helpful to use the 'dir' command inside gdb to set
    the path that gdb looks for sources with:

	dir ~ptdesign/src/octtools/vem
	
    vem bug reports
    ---------------
    Currently there is no one person responsible for tracking down vem
    bugs.

    	1) You should try to replicate the bug in the ptuser
        environment.  

	2) You should try to replicate the bug in the older, released
        version of ptolemy (~ptolemy).

	3) You should try and include a gdb stack backtrace in your
	message to ptdesign.   

	4) You should include step-by-step instructions about how to
	reproduce the bug.  Don't be afraid of including to much
	information.  Your instructions should include:
		what user you were running as
		what binaries you were running
		what directory you started from
		EXACTLY what you typed and moused on.
	Bugs that can be reproduced quickly are much more likely to be
	fixed.
    
Vem and gcc
----------- 
	
	The mm octtools library is a replacement for malloc.  Don't
	use it with gcc.  Under gcc, it causes bus errors due to
	alignment problems in vem.  (libst.a gets a bus error).
 
	In Ptolemy0.5, the wildColors demo run on a vem built with gcc
	with out the -lmm library seems to cause the following error:
	
		fatal error detected by kd (code 0):
	        in regInit:
	        out of memory (0)
		RPC Error: fread of long failed
		RPC Error: function end failure
		RPC connection to VEM closed.

	The way to tell if a vem binary includes -lmm is to run 'what'
	on it and look for the file mm.c.  If mm.c is present, then
	the vem binary was compiled with -lmm.

	The way to tell if a binary was compiled with gcc or cc is to
	use nm:
		 nm a.out | egrep 'gcc|GCC|gnu|GNU'

	In Ptolemy0.5, we did not build octtools with gcc.  In
	Ptolemy0.5.1 and later, we are building octtools with gcc.
	Between 0.5 and 0.5.1 some changes were made to Packages/kd to
	fix the above bug.
	
	Building a vem with gcc
	-----------------------
	Part of the vem build process updates the octtools libraries
	in $PTOLEMY/octtools/lib.$PTARCH.

	If you do a clean rebuild of vem with gcc, then those
	libraries will be updated.  

	You should either build gcc versions of vem in a private tree,
	or be sure to rebuild with cc, so that the octtools libraries
	are left as they were.  I believe that there are some
	differences between cc and gcc in the way that arguments are
	passed.  In theory all of Ptolemy should be built with cc, but
	that is not the case.

	If you build vem with gcc, then you should specify the
	-fwritable-strings and -traditional flags and specify a null
	OCTTOOLS_MM_LIB makefile variable.  In Ptolemy0.5.1, this is
	done for you.
	
	make CC="gcc -traditional -fwritable-strings" OCTTOOLS_MM_LIB= 

	The OCTTOOLS_MM_LIB variable defaults to -lmm in
	src/octtool/vem/makefile, so if it is null, then the Octtools mm
	library will not be linked in.
	
Miscellaneous Notes
-------------------
*This version of vem requires the bindings and bitmaps files in
 $OCTTOOLS/lib/vem 

*The include directory exists for bootstrapping the creation of the
 makefiles.  In Ptolemy, makefiles are created from make.templates.
 Part of the makefile creation process is to run make depend in the
 current directory.  If the .h files are not available, then the make
 depend will not create the proper dependencies.

 To actually build a vem binary, you must install the libraries in
 Packages/* and Xpackages/* into $OCTTOOLS/lib.$PTARCH.

*$OCTTOOLS/include should be an exact copy of the include directory.
 $OCTTOOLS/include would be used if you were going to link the
 Octtools libraries in a binary.

*Once vem is installed, you can remove this directory.

*The file vem-lib.mk is a makefile that is included in
 Packages/*/makefile and Xpackages/*/makefile.

*The file vem-bin.mk is a makefile that is included in
 vem/*makefile

*Packages/options/options.c:optAddUnivOptions()
 gcc-2.5.6 was dumping core here.  Looks like there is some sort of
 compiler bug with the |= operation

*The include file 'port.h' is included by many different files.
 port.h is in three places:
	$PTOLEMY/src/octtools/Packages/port/port.h	The source file
	
	$PTOLEMY/src/octtools/include/port.h		Used when
							compiling octtools.
	
	$PTOLEMY/octtools/include/port.h		Included by other
							Ptolemy files.
	
 If you need to make changes to port.h, make your changes in
 $PTOLEMY/src/octtools/Packages/port/port.h, and do a make all.
