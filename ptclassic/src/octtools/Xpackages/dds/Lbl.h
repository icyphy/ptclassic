 * Lbl is a subclass of the Athena Label widget that uses
 * a slightly different method to compute preferred geometry.
 * This new method returns the actual size of the widget when
 * the resize resource is set.  Everything else about the
 * class is inherited.
 *
 * These are the public definitions for using the class.
