This directory contains a modified version of the pat2tap
program from the Berkeley octtools distribution.
The program has been modified to work more easily with Ptolemy,
and has been renamed "installColors".

The following instructions assume the environment variable PTOLEMY
points to the root of the Ptolemy directory tree.

To use the program:

A text file is used to define the colors used by vem to display ptolemy
facets.  In Vem terminology, it defines the "ptolemy technology."
The colors can be changed, and users can define their own colors.
The default ptolemy colors are defined in
    $PTOLEMY/lib/colors/ptolemy/colors.pat for color monitors; and
    $PTOLEMY/lib/colors/ptolemy/bw.pat for black and white monitors.

Editing the text file is not sufficient to effect changes to the colors.
The colors must be incorporated into the tap.views facet for any
changes to take effect.  This can be done as follows:

        cd $PTOLEMY/lib/colors/ptolemy
	vi colors.pat
        installColors

The last line invokes a program located in $PTOLEMY/octtools/bin.sun4, where
'sun4' may be replaced with whatever machine type you are running on.
The dialog with the program should proceed as follows:
	Name of the color pattern file [colors.pat]:
	Directory in which ptolemy technology is installed
		[~ptolemy/lib/colors]:
	Do you wish to specify an X host and display other
		than the one in your DISPLAY variable? [no]:
	Output display type [MIT X Consortium]:
        Color output device [yes]:

If you are modified the colors in $PTOLEMY/lib/colors/colors.pat,
the defaults will work.  Otherwise, you must enter answers to the above
questions.  The program uses your DISPLAY environment variable to
determine your output display type ("MIT X Consortium" above).
If you wish to over-ride this, you can answer "yes" to the third
query.  You will then be asked for a display name.
The other output devices that you may wish to specify include
GENERIC-COLOR and PostScript-BW.

The file colors.pat is pretty self-explanatory.
Larger priorities 0,1,2,... indicate greater visibility priority.
Priorities may evidently be arbitrarily large.

If you wish to create your own colors, you may create a directory
like this one somewhere.  Suppose you define your colors in a directory
called "~myLogin/myColors".  Then

        mkdir ~myLogin/myColors
        cd ~myLogin/myColors
        cp -r $PTOLEMY/lib/colors/ptolemy .
        cd ptolemy
        vi colors.pat

Edit colors.pat, run installColors as explained above,
and set the X resources as follows:

vem.technology:  ~myLogin/myColors

NOTE THAT FOR SOME REASON I DON'T UNDERSTAND, THE PIGI COMMAND
OVERRIDES THIS X RESOURCE.  ONLY SOLUTION I KNOW OF IS TO CREATE
YOUR OWN pigi SCRIPT.
		Partial explaination of above problem.  The current
		pigi script does an xrdb -merge, with the standard
		ptolemy vem resources.  The overrides any resources
		you specify in your resources.  We hope to switch
		to application default resources soon, which should
		eliminate this problem.

You should also update the pointers in your new color specification
by running the masters program:

	cd ~myLogin/myColors
	masters tap.views
Using this program, replace any instances of "$PTOLEMY/lib/colors"
with "~myLogin/myColors".

Then restart pigi.

Note: You can save a little disk space by creating symbolic links to
parts of the directory you do not wish to change.
For instance, the files of form myColors/ptolemy/%* may be OK
as they are.



To make installColors, in a C shell, type "setenv OCTTOOLS ~octtools".
Then "make".


--------
The program includes a cleanup routine, explained by its author below:
Author: Wan-Teh Chang  wtc@eecs.berkeley.edu

After editing the vem pattern files, one uses pat2tap to generate the
tap.views facet.  However the tap.views we get has lot of "edges" 
(two per layer) whose use I don't know.  These edges are collected
in the DESIGN-RULES bag in tap.views.  They have the effect of making
all paths having a width of 2, thus resulting in "fat" lines.

From experience we found we don't need any design rules for Ptolemy.
So cleantap is written to remove these spurious edges in the 
DESIGN-RULES bag, sort of "clean up tap.views", hence the name.

---------
technologies (Kennard White)
All octtools programs understand a "technology root directory".  This
is specified with the "vem*technology" resource or with the "=-T" option.
This directory then has a set of directories, which each directory corresponding
to a particular technology.  For ptolemy, the root directory is
"$PTOLEMY/lib/colors", and the name of the technology is "ptolemy".
Thus the ptolemy technology resides in "$PTOLEMY/lib/colors/ptolemy".
Within this directory, there is one key facet "tap.views" which contains
all the configuration information about the technology.  In particular,
it contains all the color information, design rules, pointers to
all the connectors, and pointers to all the layers.  The technology directory
also contains "key" OCT cells for the technology.  We put these in the
system pallete.
