Ptolemy universes and galaxies are "oct facets", where oct is
a design database.  For every icon in these facets, there
is a master somewhere in the file system.  The master identifies
the Ptolemy star or galaxy associated with the icon, and also defines
the appearance of the icon.
The master is specified using a complete Unix pathname,
usually relative to an environment variable like "PTOLEMY"
or a user's home directory, like "~ptolemy".
.pp
Whenever stars or galaxies are moved to a different location
in the file system, any universe or galaxy using their icons
will be rendered invalid.  This program is used to replace
such invalid masters with correct masters.  It can also be used
just to list the masters in a facet, or to replace a valid master
with a different version, also a valid master.
.pp
This program is a version of the octmvlib program
from the octtools distribution.  It has been made more user-friendly,
and has been customized for use with Ptolemy.
.H1 "Invoking masters"
.pp
The simplest way to use this program is interactively:
.(b C
masters facet(s)
.)b
The arguments are the names of the facets that you wish to modify.
You will be prompted for a pathname to replace. If you enter a
question mark, the pathnames in the first facet will be listed, with
invalid pathnames marked.
The same replacements will be made on the all facets specified on
the command line.
If you wish to replace more than one master, just run the program again.
.pp
The program may be run non-interactively by specifying the old and
new pathnames on the command line using the syntax:
.(b C
masters -O 'old_path_name' -N 'new_path_name' facet(s)
.)b
The single quotes are advisable to avoid expansion of "~user"
.EQ

.EN
or "$VARIABLE_NAME" entries.

Specifying the "-v" option causes the program to give a bit more information
as it runs, as in
.(b C
masters -v facet(s)
.)b
