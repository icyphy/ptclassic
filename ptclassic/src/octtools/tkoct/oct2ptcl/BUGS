List of known bugs in oct2ptcl:

1) oct2ptcl is too picky about some facets.  It thinks facets are
corrupt, but the facet will work fine in Ptolemy.  oct2ptcl is
technically correct here, but by not processing semi-corrupt facets,
oct2ptcl is not very useful

2) oct2ptcl has not been extended to handle initializable delays.
The mdsdf:test:IIRusingFIR demo uses initializable delays.
If we run oct2ptcl on this facet, we get:
    connect Fork.output=21 output#2 FIR1 input

However, if we compile this facet with ptolemy, we get:
    connect Fork.output=21 output#2 FIR1 input "0 1"
