 *
 * This file contains easy to use programming interfaces for common
 * dialog operations.  These are usually short moded dialogs which
 * ask questions that require an answer immediately.  The prefix of
 * these routines is "dm".
 *
 * This package is now implemented on top of the more powerful
 * Xt toolkit based package "dds".  It is provided for
 * compatibility.  The library must be initialized using
 * dmCompatInit().
 *
 * This file contains routines implementing the dmMessage interface.

/*
 * This routine presents an unmoded dialog that shows `message'
 * in a window.  The text may have newlines.  If there are more
 * than 10 lines,  the window will be made scrollable.  One
 * control button will be placed down at the bottom that causes
 * the window to go away.  If `auto_format' is non-zero, the
 * text of the message will be broken into lines automatically.
 * New paragraphs are started by blank lines.  If `auto_format'
 * is zero,  the formatting will the same as that given in the
 * message.
