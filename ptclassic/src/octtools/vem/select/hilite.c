 * Highlight Set Access Routines

 *
 * This file contains the initialization routines for a globally accessible
 * highlight selected set.  To use the highlight set,  the caller calls
 * the routine vemGetHiLite which gives control to caller.  No one else
 * can use the set until it is released by vemRelHiLite.
 *
 * What is passed back is a vemSelSet which has been initialized and cleared.
 * Objects can be added and deleted from it to highlight geometry.
