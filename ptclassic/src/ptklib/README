This directory contains routines that are written in C, interface Tcl,
and are used by both code generation and simulation domains in Ptolemy.
They are meant to be kept very lean, so that they can be lightweight
utilities in generated code.

Policy:

All routines callable from C or C++ should return an error status
(0 for error, 1 for OK).  The caller will be responsible for reporting
the error to the user.

All routines callable from C++ should have declarations in corresponding .h
file.  The .h file is to be used by C++ callers only.

All routines callable from Tcl should return TCL_ERROR if an error occurs,
after having placed the error message in the interp->result.
They should not report the error directly.
