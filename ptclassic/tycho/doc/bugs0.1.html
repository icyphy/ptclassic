<p>
<h2>Key Limitations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Lack of infrastructure for graphical editors.
<li>The HTML parser is too slow on most machines.
<li>HTTP is not supported, so hyperlinks can only be to local files.
<li>Crash recovery code only works with Ptolemy binaries.
<li>Lack of a preference manager.  X window resources are used.
<li>Lack of a color manager.
<li>The undo in the text widgets is only one level deep.
<li>Several of the editors are not fully developed, containing
only rudimentary syntax-directed features.
<li>Editors are too closely allied with their top-level windows, so that
if you place multiple editors in a single window, you will have to carefully
design your menus to be able to interact with all subwindows.
<li>File completion in the file browser window only works if file is
in the current directory.
</ul>

<H2>Detailed Bug Descriptions</H2>

<H3>RCS mode bug</H3>
	Unfortunately, if RCS does not necessarily put the version
	control files in the RCS subdirectory.  If the RCS
	subdirectory does not exist, then the directory is not created
	and the version control file is put in the current directory.

	 <P>If I do the following to create a version control file in
	the current directory,
	<PRE>
	cxh@brahe 23% rm -rf RCS
	cxh@brahe 24% chmod u+w log.itcl
	cxh@brahe 25% ci -u log.itcl
	log.itcl,v  &lt;--  log.itcl
	enter description, terminated with single '.' or end of file:
	NOTE: This is NOT the log message!
	&gt;&gt; This is the description for log.itcl
	&gt;&gt; .
	initial revision: 1.1
	done
	cxh@brahe 26%
	</PRE>

	 <P>then when I try to check out <CODE>logs.itcl</CODE>
	from within Tycho, I get
	a message stating that the file is not checked in, and would I
	like to do so.  My guess is that Tycho is looking for an
	<CODE>RCS</CODE> or <CODE>SCCS</CODE> subdirectory, and not the
	<CODE>log.itcl,v</CODE> file.  This is a minor bug.

<H3>Tycho Console Class bug</H3>

The X Window System Class of the Tycho console is <CODE>Console</CODE>.
This means if <CODE>fvwm</CODE> is set so that windows named
<CODE>Console</CODE> are sticky (present on all virtual screens), then
the Tycho console is sticky too.  The <CODE>xprop</CODE> command shows
that the Tycho console's class is <CODE>Console</CODE>.
