<h1>Using the Tcl <i>after</i> command in Itcl</h1>
<p>

When building an object-oriented widget hierarchy
in Itcl, you will occasionally come across the following
problems:
<ol>

<li>Code in a base class constructor cannot properly execute until the
derived class constructors have been executed. For example, the Tycho
File class, as part of its file management support, calls the
<CODE>reload</CODE> method in its constructor.  However, the action
taken on a file reload depends on options set in the constructors of
derived classes.

<li>Code that is executed in a constructor does not work
properly because it depends on the size of a widget, and
a widget's size is not known until it is mapped to the
screen. For example, the Tycho StatusBar class needs to
know the size of the message pane in order to prevent
wraparound of a message.

</ol>

<p>The common approach to these problems is to use the Tcl <a
name="after"><CODE>after</CODE></a> command, generally with the
<CODE>idle</CODE> argument. For example, the File constructor used to
contain the line

<pre>
    after idle [code evalIfExists $this reload]
</pre>

<p>The problem with this approach is that, with a few levels in the
hierarchy, you start to build a spaghetti of <CODE>after</CODE>
commands and widgets start to become fragile. We therefore added some
more structured support to Tycho for these situations, with the
methods <code>whenConstructed</code> and <code>whenMapped</code>.
These methods are available to all descendents of the
<CODE>::tycho::TWidget</CODE> and <CODE>::tycho::TopLevel</CODE>
classes.

<p> <h3><a name="whenConstructed">whenConstructed</a></h3>

<p> The TWidget and TopLevel classes contain the protected method
<CODE>whenConstructed</CODE>. This method takes a single argument,
which is a command to be executed just before the call to
<CODE>itk_initialize</CODE> returns in the most specific constructor
of the widget. More than one command can be passed to this method. The
accumulated commands are executed in the same scope in which they were
created.

 <P>For example, the constructor of File now contains the line
<pre>
    whenConstructed "$this reload"
</pre>

This ensure that the widget reload takes place within the
last constructor, but before the Tk event loop is reentered.
If this method is called and the widget has been
constructed already, then the passed command is evaluated
immediately.

<p>
<h3><a name="whenMapped">whenMapped</a></h3>
<p>

Some code depends on a widget being mapped to the screen before it can
work correctly. The <CODE>whenMapped</CODE> method supports this
requirement in a more robust way than <CODE>after idle</CODE>. The
method takes two arguments: the name of the component (of the
megawidget from which the method is being called) to wait for, and the
command to execute.  When the given component is mapped to the screen,
any pending commands for that component are evaluated. As for
<CODE>whenConstructed</CODE>, evaluation takes place in the context
from which <CODE>whenMapped</CODE> was originally called.

 <P>For example, the StatusBar would wrap a status message incorrectly
if it was written (with the <CODE>putMessage</CODE> method) before the
containing window was fully mapped to the screen. The following
code sequence solved the problem:

<pre>
    if ![winfo ismapped [component message]] {
        whenMapped message [list $this putMessage $string]
    } else {
        ...
    }
</pre>

This code defers the message display until the message
component is mapped to the screen, ensuring that
the message wrap-around works correctly.

<p> <h3><a name="deferred redrawing">Deferred redrawing</a></h3>

<p> Widgets that have an expensive redraw should use <code>whenMapped</code>
to defer their redrawing until the containing window has been
fully mapped to the screen. For example, the HTML and
EditDAG widgets do this. The way to do this is to modify the
<code>insertData</code> method of the widget so that the call to the
redrawing routine is deferred with <code>whenMapped</code>.

<p>For example, <CODE>HTML.itcl</CODE> contains the code:

<pre>
    whenMapped text "::tycho::safeUpdate $this"
    whenMapped text [list ::tycho::HTML::render $this $data]
</pre>

<p>In general, the call to <code>safeUpdate</code> is not
needed, but (for reasons I don't fully understand) it works
better for this widget.

<p>The EditDAG widget has a similar call -- in this case,
the call to <code>safeUpdate</code> is not needed:
<pre>
    whenMapped slate "$this redrawGraph"
</pre>
