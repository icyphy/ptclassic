<h1>Tycho Copyrights</h1>

Please don't check this file in with SCCS, or the SCCS variables will
not be visible.

	All files should have copyrights.  We use two different forms
	of copyrights, a shorter one for interpreted files, and a
	longer one for compiled files.  

	 <P>Please see the Tycho
	<A HREF="style.html#copyright">style</A> guide for further
	details about copyrights

<H2>SCCS and copyrights</H2>

	Currently we are using the %Q% (percentQpercent) sccs
	directive to adjust the copyright dates automatically.  The
	copyright should have %Q% as the ending date of the copyright:
	1990-%Q%
	If you are setting up a new directory, then you should do:
	<pre>
	sccs admin -fq1995 SCCS
	</pre>
	
	to set the Q variable in the SCCS directory.  Note that after
	doing the sccs admin command, 'make sources' will check out
	all the files in that directory.  If you are adding a new
	file, you can do:
	
	<pre>
	sccs admin -fq1995 SCCS mynewfile.cc
	</pre>
	
	See <A
	HREF="file:///users/ptdesign/adm/copyrights"><CODE>~ptdesign/adm/copyrights</CODE></A>
	for the script that can automatically updated copyrights.<p>

<hr>
<H2>Copyright for interpreted files</H2>
Interpreted files, such as tcl files should have the following copyright

(Note that makefiles should not have this copyright, rather, they
should have the copyright for compiled files, since makefiles are
likely to actually be read)

Next year we will need to change "%Q%" to 1995-%Q%, but I guess
the string is sufficiently unique that this should be OK.

<HR>
<H2>Copyright for compiled files</H2>
Note that makefiles should have this style of copyright, except each line should start with a hash mark: <CODE>#</CODE>
