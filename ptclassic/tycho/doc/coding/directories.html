<h1><a name="tycho directory layout">Tycho directory layout</a></h1>
<p>
Tycho has a certain directory structure that you need to know about
if you are planning on extending tycho.
<p>
<MENU>
	<LI> <A HREF="../../README.files"><CODE>$TYCHO/README.files</CODE></A>
	contains a description of the Tycho directory structure.

<HR>
<H3><A NAME="tylndir and private trees"><CODE>tylndir</CODE></A></H3>

The script 
<A HREF="../../bin/tylndir"><CODE>$TYCHO/bin/tylndir</CODE></A>
 will create a private directory tree with links to a common Tycho
tree.  This allows Tycho developers to maintain their own tree and
edit it as they see fit and to get changes that other developers make.

 <P>For example, to create your own private tree in <CODE>~/ty</CODE> from
the master sources in <CODE>~ptdesign/tycho</CODE>, do the following:
<OL>
<LI> <CODE>mkdir ~/ty</CODE>

<LI> <CODE>cd ~/ty</CODE>

<LI> <CODE>~ptdesign/tycho/bin/tylndir ~ptdesign/tycho</CODE>

<LI> Set your <CODE>TYCHO</CODE> environment to <CODE>~/ty</CODE>.
If you are running the C shell, you would type:
<PRE>
setenv TYCHO ~/ty
</PRE>
You could place the above line in your <CODE>.cshrc</CODE> file so that
it is set each time you log in.

<LI> Place <CODE>$TYCHO/bin</CODE> in your path:
<PRE>
set path = ($TYCHO/bin $path)
</PRE>

<LI> Start Tycho with files in your private tree by typing <CODE>tycho</CODE>.

</OL>

<CODE>tylndir</CODE> is not perfect, as it will create links for garbage
files such as <CODE>,*</CODE> and <CODE>*~</CODE> in your private tree.

 <P>The tree that <CODE>tylndir</CODE> builds has links for the
<CODE>SCCS</CODE> directories, so that everyone is sharing the
the master <CODE>~ptdesign</CODE> <CODE>SCCS</CODE> directories via links.

 <P>When you start using your tree, most of the files are also links.
If you check out a file, then the link is removed, and checked out
version of the file is put in its place.  The SCCS version control system
creates a lock file in the shared <CODE>SCCS</CODE> directory.
so that noone can check out that file while you have it checked out.

 <P>To update your tree, you do <CODE>cd $TYCHO; make sources</CODE>.
This will update any files that have been changed by others.

 <P>It would be nice if we had CVS and could have concurrent and truly
parallel trees, but the amount of training is fairly substantial.

<HR>
<H3><A NAME="makefile structure">makefile structure</A></H3>

 <P>It is best if the makefiles do not contain any
<A NAME="gnu make">GNU <CODE>make</CODE></A>
 extensions so that the makefiles can be used with non-GNU
<CODE>make</CODE>.  Over time we are migrating away from makefiles and
using Tcl scripts and the BuilderDialog instead.

 <P>
The Makefile editor can insert a makefile template by using the
<CODE>Template</CODE> choice of the <CODE>Special</CODE> menu.
<A HREF="../../editors/textedit/templates/Cmakefile.mk"><CODE>$TYCHO/editors/textedi/templates/Cmakefile.mk</CODE></A> contains the template that the
Makefile editor actually inserts.

The general structure of a Tycho makefile is
<OL>

<LI> A header that includes a one line summary, author, version and
copyright information.

<LI> A section that sets the makefile variables <CODE>ROOT</CODE> and
<CODE>VPATH</CODE>.

<DL> 

<DT> <CODE>ROOT</CODE>
<DD> is a relative path to the top of the Tycho distribution

<DT> <CODE>VPATH</CODE>
<DD> is a pathname to the current directory that uses <CODE>$(ROOT)</CODE>.

</DL>

For example, <A
HREF="../../kernel/makefile"><CODE>$TYCHO/kernel/makefile</CODE></A>
 contains:

<PRE>
# Root of Tycho directory
ROOT =		..

# True source directory
VPATH =		$(ROOT)/kernel
</PRE>

<LI> A section that includes <A
HREF="../../mk/tycho.mk"><CODE>$TYCHO/mk/tycho.mk</CODE></A>, which is
a makefile that sets common makefile variables.  For example:

<PRE>
# Get configuration info
CONFIG =	$(ROOT)/mk/tycho.mk
include $(CONFIG)
</PRE>


<LI> A section that sets makefile variables to files in the current
directory.
<DL>

<DT> <CODE>TCL_SRCS</CODE>
<DD> Tcl source files that usually have a <CODE>.tcl</CODE> suffix

<DT> <CODE>ITCL_SRCS</CODE>
<DD> Itcl source files that usually have a <CODE>.itcl</CODE> suffix


<DT> <CODE>EXTRA_SRCS</CODE>

<DD> Usually set to <CODE>$(TCL_SRCS) $(ITCL_SRCS)</CODE>.  The name
<CODE>EXTRA_SRCS</CODE> is from Ptolemy and indicates that these files
are not compiled or otherwise processed.

<DT> <CODE>MISC_FILES</CODE>
<DD> This variable lists files that are part of the distribution but are
not source files per se.  <CODE>MISC_FILES</CODE> usually includes
the names of any subdirectories, along with <CODE>tclIndex</CODE> and
any <CODE>README</CODE> files that might be present.
<CODE>make checkjunk</CODE> uses this variable.


<DT> <CODE>DIRS</CODE>
<DD> This variable lists any subdirectories that we should run make in.

<DT> <CODE>REALCLEAN_STUFF</CODE>
<DD> Files to be removed by <CODE>make realclean</CODE>

<DT> <CODE>TYDOC_DESC</CODE>
<DD> Title for the tydoc documentation system index page.

</DL>


<LI> The next section consists of any rules.  Usually there is only
a <CODE>all</CODE> and <CODE>install</CODE> rule:
<PRE>
all install: sources $(MISC_SRCS) tclIndex
</PRE>


<LI> The final section includes the makefile that has rules that are
common to all Tycho makefiles.  This <A NAME="no-compile.mk">file</A>
is usually <A
HREF="../../mk/no-compile.mk"><CODE>$TYCHO/mk/no-compile.mk</CODE></A>

</OL>


<HR>
<H3><A NAME="makefile rules">makefile rules</A></H3>

The following makefile rules are defined in <A
HREF="../../mk/no-compile.mk"><CODE>$TYCHO/mk/no-compile.mk</CODE></A>
These rules are useful when extending Tycho.


<DL>

<DT> <CODE>make sources</CODE>

<DD> This rule will update any source files that are out of date.  The
publicly available distribution of Tycho does not include version
control files, but the development distribution at UC Berkeley does
have version control files.  If a directory has version control files,
then <CODE>make sources</CODE> will update any files that have changed
in the master tree, but not in the local tree.

<DT> <CODE>make all</CODE>

<DD> For the most part, Tycho uses interpreted files that do not
require compilation, so <CODE>make all</CODE> does things like create
<CODE>tclIndex</CODE> files, and fix the permissions on scripts.  
<CODE>make all</CODE> also runs the <CODE>make sources</CODE> rules.


<DT> <CODE>make install</CODE>

<DD> In Tycho, <CODE>make install</CODE> usually just does whatever
<CODE>make all</CODE> does.  In Tycho, there is no need to run
<CODE>make install</CODE> after running <CODE>make all</CODE>.
<CODE>make install</CODE> is present only for compatibility with other
packages, such as Ptolemy.


</DL>

<H4><A NAME="file manipulation makefile rules">File Manipulation
makefile rules</A></H4>

The following makefile rules are used to manipulate files in the distribution
<DL>

<DT> <CODE>make clean</CODE>
<DD> This rule removes files that are generated by installation or 
editing files.   The files removed include: <CODE>*.o core *~ *.bak ,*</CODE>

<DT> <CODE>make realclean</CODE>

<DD> This rule does everything <CODE>make clean</CODE> does, and it
removed any files named in the <CODE>REALCLEAN_STUFF</CODE> makefile
variable.  For example, in <A
HREF="../../kernel/makefile"><CODE>$TYCHO/kernel/makefile</CODE></A>
<CODE>REALCLEAN_STUFF</CODE> is set so that <CODE>tclIndex</CODE> is
removed when <CODE>make realclean</CODE> is run


<DT> <CODE>make extraclean</CODE>

<DD> This rule removes the sources, along with everything that
<CODE>make realclean</CODE> does.  Note that to retrieve the sources
automatically after running <CODE>make extraclean</CODE>you need to
have the sources checked into RCS or SCCS.  The publically available
distribution of Tycho does not include SCCS files, so running this
command is not recommended. <CODE>make extraclean sources</CODE> is a
good way to change all the links created by <CODE>tylndir</CODE> into
actual files.

<DT> <CODE>make sccsinfo</CODE>

<DD> This rule is only useful if the Tycho distribution has SCCS
version control information.  The publicly available distribution does
not have SCCS version control information, so this rule is only useful
in the Tycho development tree.  <CODE>make sccsinfo</CODE> traverses
the distribution and runs <CODE>sccs info</CODE> in each directory.
<CODE>sccs info</CODE> prints out the names of any files that are checked out.


<DT> <CODE>make checkjunk</CODE>

<DD> The <CODE>make checkjunk</CODE> rule traverses the distribution
and prints the names of any files that are not mentioned in the
makefile.  This rule is useful for cleaning up the distribution
before release.
