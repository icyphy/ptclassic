The <a href="../../editors/textedit/templates/ItclTemplate.itcl">Itcl
template</a> file contains a template of an Itcl file with the
appropriate copyright and comment formats.

 <P>The Itcl editor has a
<A

Editor File Template"><CODE>File Template</CODE>menu choice</A>
that will insert the Itcl template file.

 <P>Below is a sample header:

<H3><A NAME="doc tags">Doc Tags</A></H3>

The header contains <I>doc tags</I> to identify different parts of the
header.  Doc tags are more fully described in the <A
HREF="../../lib/tydoc/doc/index.html"><CODE>tydoc</CODE></A>
documentation, but briefly, a doc tag is a keyword, such as
<CODE>@Author</CODE> that is at the start of a comment.  Doc tags are
case-insensitive, and my be pluralized.  The trailing colon
"<CODE>:</CODE>" is optional, and it is not part of the doc tag.  If
the trailing colon is present, the tydoc removes it from the comment.

<H3><A NAME="the order of elements">The order of elements</A></H3>
	
The file header consists of the following elements, separated by blank
lines.  Note that the order of tags should be strictly followed for
consistency between files.
	
<OL>
	<LI> A one line description of what the file does

	<LI>  <CODE>@Author:</CODE> -
	The primary Author(s) of the file.  If you have more than one
	author, use <CODE>@Authors:</CODE>.  With multiple authors, the
	last two names should be separated by <CODE>and</CODE>
	<PRE>
	# @Authors: Author One, Author Two and Author Three
	</PRE>
	Please try to follow the existing naming convention that
	people use for themselves, some people use a middle initial,
	some don't.

	<LI>  <CODE>@Contributor:</CODE> -
	(Optional) People who have contributed to this file.  If there
	is more than one contributor, you can pluralize this.	
	
	<LI> <CODE>@Version:</CODE> -
	The Version control information for this file.  The version
	control system can automatically update special characters at
	file check in time, so that the file can contain the date and
	version number.  Currently, we are using SCCS at UC Berkeley.
	If you use the string
	<PRE>
	# @Version: &#37;W&#37; &#37;G&#37;
	</PRE>
	Then SCCS will convert this to the file name, version number
	and date:
	<PRE>
	# @Version: @(#)Tycho.tcl	1.37	6/14/96
	</PRE>
	Note that there is a space between
	<CODE>&#37;W&#37; &#37;G&#37;</CODE>, not a tab.

	<LI> <CODE>@Copyright</CODE> - The Copyright for this file.
	Usually <CODE>@Copyright</CODE> is not followed by a colon.
	The issue of copyrights is fairly tricky, if you are an
	employee of UC Berkeley, you should include the copyright as
	it is printed above.  Note that the special symbol is expanded
	at our site at UC Berkeley to be the current year.  The <A
	HREF="style.html#copyright conventions">Tycho style guide</A>
	contains more information about copyrights.
