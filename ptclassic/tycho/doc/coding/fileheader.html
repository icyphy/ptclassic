<H3>Doctags</H3>

The header contains <I>doc tags</I> to identify different parts of the
header.  Doc tags are more fully described in the <A
HREF="../../lib/tydoc/doc/introduction.html"><CODE>tydoc</CODE></A>
documentation, but briefly, a doc tag is a keyword, such as
<CODE>@Author</CODE> that is at the start of a comment.  Doc tags are
case-insensitive, and my be pluralized.  The trailing colon
"<CODE>:</CODE>" is optional, and it is not part of the doc tag.  If
the trailing colon is present, the tydoc removes it from the comment.

<DL>
<DT> <CODE>@Author:</CODE>
<DD> The primary Author(s) of the file.  

<DT> <CODE>@Contributor:</CODE>
<DD> People who have contributed to this file.

<DT> <CODE>@Version:</CODE>

<DD> The Version control information for this file.  The version
control system can automatically update special characters at file
check in time, so that the file can contain the date and version
number.  Currently, we are using SCCS at UC Berkeley.  If you use the
string
<LISTING>
# @Version: $Id$
</LISTING>
Then SCCS will convert this to the file name, version number and date:
<LISTING>
# @Version: @(#)Tycho.tcl	1.37	6/14/96
</LISTING>
Note that there is a space between $Id$, not a tab.
</DL>


<DT> <CODE>@Copyright</CODE>

<DD> The Copyright for this file.  Usually <CODE>@Copyright</CODE> is
not followed by a colon.  The issue of copyrights is fairly tricky, if
you are an employee of UC Berkeley, you should include the copyright
as it is printed above.  Note that the special symbol <CODE>%Q%</CODE>
or <CODE>percentQpercent</CODE> is expanded at our site at UC Berkeley
to be the current year.
