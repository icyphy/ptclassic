When creating new Java or Itcl class files please be sure that they
will compile or source before adding them to the
<CODE>makefile</CODE>. This ensures that make still works for others
working on files in the same directory.

<OL>

<LI> Create a new class file using the <CODE>File Template</CODE>
command under the <CODE>Special</CODE> menu and enter the minimum code
necessary to make it compile or source.

<LI> Check out the <CODE>makefile</CODE> and add the new file to it.
You can use the <CODE>Revision Control</CODE> menu choice under the
<CODE>File</CODE> menu to do this.

<LI> If the file is a Java file, run <CODE>make</CODE> and make sure
that the new class compiles.  If the file is a Itcl file, source the
file to be sure that it has no source-time errors.

<LI> Check the class file into version control with the <CODE>Revision
Control</CODE> menu choice.
	
<LI> Check the <CODE>makefile</CODE> back in.

<LI> Check the new class out of version control and keep working on it.
