In a stock Tcl binary, you can use the <CODE>time</CODE> command
to measure the execution time of a command.  The
format of the command is: <CODE>time</CODE> <I>tcl_command</I> <I>optional_repetition_count</I>.  For example:
<PRE>
% time {foreach i [list a b c d e ] { lappend result $i}} 
808 microseconds per iteration
% time {foreach i [list a b c d e ] { lappend result $i}}  10
259 microseconds per iteration
% time {foreach i [list a b c d e ] { lappend result $i}}  100
244 microseconds per iteration
</PRE>

The TclX package includes a <CODE>profile</CODE> command which can be
used to return a call stack.  TclX can be found at <A

 <P>Tycho uses <CODE>profile</CODE> to provide a <A

<LI> Accessing large lists can really slow things down, using arrays
is much faster.  When you access an element in a list, the list must
be reparsed, whereas arrays use a hash table, so access is nearly O(N).

<LI> <CODE>array names foo {* something *}</CODE> is not only linearly
growing with the size of the array, but seems to take about 1ms per
element on a Sparc20/100.

<LI> Iterating through large data structures in Tcl is often slow.
For each iteration, Tcl reparses the body of the loop or procedure.
Brent Welch suggests the following hand-tuning methods:

<MENU>
<LI> Inside a loop, shorter variable and procedure names can help.
The Tcl <CODE>rename</CODE> command can be useful in renaming long names
to shorter names.

<LI> Moving large comment blocks outside of inner loops and frequently
called procedure bodies can help.  In the Tcl interpreter, comments
are not removed, they are parsed each time the interpreter iterates
through a loop or executes a procedure.

<LI> If you are using <CODE>exec</CODE>, then you may want to reconsider.
<OL>
<LI> The Tcl <CODE>exec</CODE> is not portable to non-unix platforms.

<LI> There is a lot of overhead in starting another process.  For
example, calling the Unix <CODE>date</CODE> command is fairly slow:
<PRE>
% time {exec date}
287316 microseconds per iteration
% time {puts [clock format [clock seconds]]}
Sun Sep 22 16:10:33 PDT 1996
1606 microseconds per iteration
% 
</PRE>
See the <A HREF="../../kernel/doc/internals/exec.html">Tycho Exec Internals Guide</A>.

<LI> If your application is taking a long time to start up, try the following:
<OL>
<LI> Use the 
<A
HREF="../../editors/visedit/doc/usersGuides/ProfileTclHelp.html">Graphical
Tcl Profiler</A> to look for bottlenecks.  Look for lots of calls to <CODE>unknown</CODE> and <CODE>tcl_unknown</CODE>.

<LI> Autoloading Itcl files takes more time than just sourcing them.
If you source the files necessary before creating your first widget,
you might see a speedup.  You might find it interesting to put
<CODE>puts</CODE> statements at the top of the <CODE>unknown</CODE>,
<CODE>tcl_unknown</CODE> and <CODE>auto_load</CODE> procs in
<CODE>lib/itcl/tcl/init.tcl</CODE> (if you are using Tycho from within
Ptolemy, then this file would be at <A
HREF="../../../../tcltk/itcl/lib/itcl/tcl/init.tcl"><CODE>$PTOLEMY/tcltk/itcl/lib/itcl/tcl/init.tcl</CODE></A>).
However, this link may not work for you.
