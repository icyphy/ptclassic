<h1>Using the Tcl "update" command in Itcl</h1>
<p>
Calling <a name=update>"update"</a> or even
<a name="update idletasks">"update idletasks"</a> within a method of any Itcl
object is very dangerous.  The Itcl object may be deleted during the
update, so when the update returns, you will be trying to execute a
method for an object that no longer exists.
<em>You must not call update in a method.</em>
<p>
<a name="saferUpdate procedure">
<h3>saferUpdate procedure</h3>
</a>
<p>
At least in version 2.0 of Itcl,
it seems to be safe to test a return value and exit from
a method, even if the corresponding 
object no longer exists.  Thus, for the rare
situations where you really have to call update
inside a method, Tycho provides a method called
::tycho::saferUpdate that can be used.
It returns 0 if the object is deleted during
the call to "update."  The single argument to this procedure
is the name of the object
whose method is calling saferUpdate, so the typical usage is:
<pre>
if {![::tycho::saferUpdate $this]} {return}
</pre>
Note that the "return" must not just return to another procedure
in the object.  It must entirely exit any code associated with the
object.  Thus, any method that contains a call to "safteUpdate" should
not be called within any other method, unless the failure condition
is propagated up the calling chain.
