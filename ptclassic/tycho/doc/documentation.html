<p>
In Tycho, documentation and design are integrated.
Hyperlinks can bind pretty much anything to anything.
For formatted text, Tycho uses <a name=HTML>HTML</a>,
the hypertext markup language of the Internet.
Formatted text can appear in any Tycho widget.

<p>
The HTML widget in Tycho is based on the
<a href="../lib/html_library/html/help.html">HTML library</a>
written by Stephen Uhler of Sun Microsystems, which supports all the
features of HTML 2.0.
There is currently no support in Tycho for
<a name=HTTP>HTTP</a> hyperlink references, so you cannot
read documents that reside on non-local filesystems from within Tycho.
(However under Unix, Tycho can start use <code>netscape</code> to
view Internet documents).
A <a href="../lib/html_library/html/sample.html">sample document</a>
illustrates the HTML tags that are supported.
<p>
In Tycho, documentation files are kept small.
This helps the response time of parser (which is really quite slow)
and keeps information modular.  Hyperlinks are used extensively
throughout.
An <a href="../editors/textedit/doc/usersGuides/EditHTMLHelp.html">
HTML editor</a> provides support for hyperlinks, including a utility
for checking their validity.
<p>
<h2><a name="HTML extensions">HTML Extensions</a></h2>
<p>
One key extension to HTML provided by Tycho allows <a name="Tcl
extension to HTML">embedding Tcl scripts into a document</a> in a
manner such that if the user double clicks on the script, the script will
be executed.  The HTML source for such a script is surrounded by by
the delimitters <CODE>&lt;tcl&gt;</CODE> and
<CODE>&lt;/tcl&gt;</CODE>.
For example, the HTML source
<pre>
    &lt;tcl&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
    ::tycho::post "hello world"
    &lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/tcl&gt;
</pre>
appears as follows in a document:
<tcl><pre>
    ::tycho::post "hello world"
</pre></tcl>
Double clicking on this script will execute it if you are
viewing the document under Tycho.
In the above example, the <code>post</code> command returns the name
of the widget it just created.  By default, this returned value
is displayed in a pop-up dialog box.  This can be annoying if the
returned value has no meaning to the reader.  To suppress this,
use the following syntax:
<pre>
    &lt;tcl quiet&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
    ::tycho::post "hello world"
    &lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/tcl&gt;
</pre>
which appears as follows in a document:
<tcl quiet><pre>
    ::tycho::post "hello world"
</pre></tcl>
The only difference is that the returned value is displayed
in the status bar at the bottom of the window rather than in a dialog box.
<p>
When creating embedded Tcl scripts, you may find it necessary to use
the <A HREF="http://www.sandia.gov/sci_compute/iso_symbol.html">HTML
Code Character Set</A> for things like greater-than
"<CODE>&gt;</CODE>", less-than "<CODE>&lt;</CODE>" and backslash
"<CODE>&#92</CODE>".  Greater-than is coded <CODE>&amp;gt;</CODE>,
less-than is coded <CODE>&amp;lt;</CODE> and backslash is coded
<CODE>&amp#92</CODE>.  If you don't code characters that have
meaning in HTML, then you might find that the output does not look the
way you want it.

<p> In addition, Tycho expands hypertext references that begin with a
dollar sign "<CODE>$</CODE>".  The characters up to the first slash
(or up to then end if there are no slashes) are taken to be the name
of an environment variable or a Tcl global variable.  The value of the
variable is substituted.  Also, on Unix systems, filenames beginning
with a tilde "<CODE>~</CODE>" specify files relative to a user's home
directory, in the usual Unix fashion.

<p>
When writing HTML documentation, it is best if you use relative paths
instead of using dollar sign references.
<MENU>
<LI> HTML viewers other than Tycho do not understand dollar sign references.

<LI> If the Tycho documentation is accessed from a remote system via an httpd 
server, then the dollar sign references will not expand
properly.  At UC Berkeley, we make the latest version of Tycho
available from the Ptolemy website, so remote users can preview Tycho.
If the documentation contains dollar sign references, then remote users
will have broken links.  If the documentation uses relative references,
then remote users will be able to view the documentation.
</MENU>

<P> The text that makes up a HTML link should be on one line, as some of the
HTML tools such as <CODE>htmlchek</CODE>
will not process HTML <CODE>&lt;A HREF="..."&gt;...&lt;/A&gt;</CODE>
links that are split over multiple lines.

<p>
<h2><a name="formatting documentation">Formatting Documentation</a></h2>

The Tycho documentation has a consistent look and feel.

<H3>Capitalization</H3>
Emacs, Macintosh, Tcl, Tk, Itcl, Itk, Iwidgets, Tycho, Unix and Windows 
should usually be capitalized.  For example
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Tycho0.1.1 will not work with Itcl2.0. 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

 <P>Words such as HTML or SCCS, where one would speak each letter
individually should have all the letters capitalized.  Words such as
Tcl, where one says, "Tickle" should only have the first letter
capitalized.  Michael McLennan prefers that the software he has written
be referred to as:
 <br>[incr Tcl] or Itcl
 <br>[incr Tk] or Itk
 <br>[incr Widgets] or Iwidgets


 <P>In general, it is best to avoid use of capital letters in the middle
of a word.  Exceptions to this rule are classnames, such as EditTcl
and the word "PostScript".

<H3>Fixed Width Fonts</H3>
Filenames, Environment variables, HTML examples, Key bindings,
Menu names, Menu choices.

Anything that the user is expected to type should be wrapped in
<CODE>&lt;CODE&gt;. . . &lt;/CODE&gt;</CODE>.  Please avoid wrapping
things in "quotes".  If you must use quotes, then use double quotes,
not single quotes.

 <br>Usually user input follows its own capitalization rules.  For
example, the user would type <CODE>tycho</CODE>, not
<CODE>Tycho</CODE>, even though 'Tycho' should always be capitalized.
For example: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The main program in the Tycho system is the <CODE>tycho</CODE> script.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

 <P>Itcl and Java Classnames are not wrapped in
<CODE>&lt;CODE&gt;. . .&lt;/CODE&gt;</CODE>.

 <P>When quoting material written by others, follow the original font
usage and capitalization.

<H3>Display Lists</H3>
Use Display Lists (<CODE>&lt;DL&gt; . . . <CODE>&lt;/DL&gt;</CODE></CODE>)
for describing Tcl proc args and listing 
key bindings.  When discussing a Tcl proc argument that is not a literal
name, wrap it in
<CODE>&lt;CODE&gt;&lt;I&gt; . . . &lt;/I&gt;&lt;/CODE&gt;</CODE>

<PRE>
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;CODE&gt;C-x 0&lt;/CODE&gt;&lt;dd&gt;iconify the window
&lt;/dl&gt;
</PRE>

</DL>

<H3>HTML Template File</H3>

 <P>The
HTML editor has a <CODE>File Template</CODE> choice under the
<CODE>Special</CODE> menu.  This <CODE>File Template</CODE> will fill
the current buffer with the contents of <A
HREF="../editors/textedit/templates/HTMLTemplate.html"><CODE>$TYCHO/editors/textedit/templates/HTMLTemplate.html</CODE></A>
The template has the following features:

<MENU>
<LI> The first line contains SCCS keywords 
<LI> The head includes a title, and sets the background color 
<LI> The footer includes
	<MENU>

	<LI> A relative link to <CODE>doc/index.html</CODE>.  This
	link should not use <CODE>$TYCHO</CODE> so that it can be
	browsed with a non-Tycho HTML browser.

	<LI> The UC Copyright, if applicable.

	<LI> A date when the file was last modified.  The date
	is automatically updated when the file is checked in with SCCS.

	<LI> An author.

	<LI> The footer also closes the <CODE>body</CODE>
	and <CODE>html</CODE> tags.
	</MENU>

</MENU>

A documentation directory should have the following elements:
<MENU>
<LI> A <CODE>makefile</CODE> that includes all of the <CODE>*.html</CODE>
files in the <CODE>EXTRA_SRCS</CODE> makefile variable.

<LI> A <CODE>index.html</CODE> file contains a properly formatted index
of all of the HTML files in the directory.
</MENU>

In Tycho, the <CODE>*.html</CODE> extension means that the file was
generated by a human, the <CODE>*.htm</CODE> extension means that the
file was automatically generated from some other source file.
<p>
<h2><a name="indexing documents">Indexing Documents</a></h2>
<p>
A major feature of the Tycho integrated documentation system is
its ability to automatically generate and maintain indices.
Effective use of this feature requires some discipline in writing
the HTML documents in the first place.
<p>
Index entries are constructed from <a name=anchors>anchors</a>
with a <a name="name attribute">name attribute</a>.
For example, the source for the previous sentence is
<pre>
    Index entries are constructed from &lt;a name=anchors&gt;anchors&lt;/a&gt;
    with a &lt;a name="name attribute"&gt;name attribute&lt;/a&gt;.
</pre>
When an index is created from this document, the value of the name
attribute will appear in the index with a pointer to precisely
this point in the document.  Thus, for example, the Tycho concept
index has a pointer to the above sentence under both "anchors"
and "name attribute".  Try it:
<tcl><pre>
    ::tycho::File::openContext $TYCHO/lib/idx/tycho.idx
</pre></tcl>
Notice that this index is also accessible through the <CODE>Help</CODE>
menu.
Notice also that the name attribute can (and often should) have
spaces in it.  It must be surrounded by quotation marks if it has
spaces in it.
<p>
Given one or more HTML documents, you can create an index for them
using the <code><a name="tychoMkIndex">tychoMkIndex</a></code> Tcl
command (you can invoke this in the console window).  This command
takes three or more arguments.  The first argument is the name of the
index, which will appear at the top of the index browser.  The second
argument is the name of the index file to create.  This file should
have the extension ".idx" so that it will be recognized as an index
file.  The rest of the arguments are any number of HTML file names
from which the index should be created.  Instead of listing many
files, you can use glob patterns like <CODE>*.html</CODE> for the file
names. A glob pattern can contain wildcards like <CODE>*</CODE>, which
match zero or more characters of any type.
<p>
<P>The
<A HREF="../kernel/doc/usersGuides/BuilderDialogHelp.html">BuilderDialog</A>
can also be used to create indexes for the Tycho distribution.

Once you have created an index and stored it in a file with the
extension <a name=".idx extension"><CODE>.idx</CODE></a>, that file
will be opened using an
<a href="../kernel/doc/usersGuides/IndexBrowserHelp.html"> index browser</a>.
<p>
The <A HREF="troubleshooting.html#Problems creating indices">Troubleshooting Guide</A> has hints about problems creating indices.
The <A HREF="tychoClasses.html">Tycho Class Diagram</A> guide has information
about generating graphical class diagrams.

<p>
<h2><a name="tydoc - The Tycho documentation system">
<code>tydoc</code> - The Tycho documentation system</a></h2>
The <code>tydoc</code> script, located in <code>$TYCHO/lib/tydoc</code> 
is used to convert Itcl source files to HTML.  <code>tydoc</code> is 
<a href="../lib/tydoc/doc/index.html">documented</a> separately.
<p>
<H2><a name="user's guides, adding">Adding a User's Guide</a></H2>
Each editor should have a user's guide.  If the Itcl file that contains
the editor is named <CODE>EditFoo.itcl</CODE>, the the User's Guide
should be <CODE>doc/usersGuides/EditFooHelp.html</CODE>.  
If you add a user's guide, follow these steps:
<OL>
<LI> Edit <CODE>doc/usersGuides/makefile</CODE> and add the HTML filename.

<LI> Edit <CODE>doc/usersGuides/index.html</CODE> and add a link to the file.
</OL>
 <P>In general, a <CODE>doc/</CODE> 
<A NAME="doc directory layout">directory</A>
contains the following subdirectories:
<MENU>
<LI> <CODE>internals/</CODE>: documentation for programmers and developers.
<LI> <CODE>usersGuides/</CODE>: documentation for specific widgets and classes.
<LI> <CODE>codeDoc/</CODE>: documentation automatically generated from
source files.
</MENU>
<h2><a name="itcl documentation">Itcl/Java Documentation</a></h2> 
External HTML documentation for packages such as Itcl and
<A NAME="java documentation">Java</A> can be downloaded and installed 
in specific locations so that Tycho can find the documentation.
<H3>Itcl</H3>
The Itcl2.2 includes HTML documentation in <CODE>itcl2.2/html</CODE>.

If you link <A HREF="itclhtml"><CODE>$TYCHO/doc/itclhtml</CODE></A> 
to the <CODE>itcl2.2/html</CODE> directory, then the links within the docs and 
in the <A HREF="itcllinks.html">Tcl and Itcl Internet Resources page</A>
will work properly.
<H3>Java</H3>
The Java documentation is available from <A HREF="http://www.javasoft.com"><CODE>http://www.javasoft.com</CODE></A>.  If you link
<A HREF="../java/doc/javahtml"><CODE>$TYCHO/java/doc/javahtml</CODE></A>
to the <CODE>docs/api</CODE> directory of the Java documentation distribution,
then the links within the documentation and 
<A HREF="../java/doc/javalinks.html">Java Internate Resources page</A>
should work properly.
