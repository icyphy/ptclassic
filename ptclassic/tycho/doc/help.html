<h1><a name="help">How to get help</a></h1>
<p>
All Tycho documentation is on-line.
Most windows have a Help menu at the upper right.
The most useful item in that menu in the long run is the
<CODE>Concept Index</CODE>,
which accesses the documentation via keyword search.
It opens an index browser.
The Help button in the index browser explains how to use it.
In brief, <CODE>Tab</CODE> completes partial entries, if possible.  Repeated
<CODE>Tab</CODE>s scroll through multiple matches.
Pattern searches and wildcards are also supported in the browser.
<p>
Many Tycho menu commands are available through keyboard shortcuts
so that you do not need to interrupt your typing to use the mouse.
If you find the keyboard shortcuts unfamiliar, you will want to study the
<a href="bindings.html">bindings documentation</a> soon.
<p>
The items in the help menu and their usefulness
are explained below:
<p>
<dl>
<dt><code>About Tycho</code>
<dd>This opens the Tycho welcome window, which has a hyperlink to the
    top level of the Tycho documentation.  This provides a convenient
    starting point for new users.  You should scan the available
    documentation to get a feel for what is there.
<dt><code>Tycho Home Page</code>
<dd>The main entry point into the documentation.
<dt><code>Guide to ...</code>
<dd>This points to the documentation for whatever widget belongs to
    the help menu.  For example, the HTML viewer will have the menu
    command <CODE>Guide to the ::tycho::HTML widget</CODE>.  All Tycho widget
    names begin with <CODE>::tycho::</CODE>, which designates the namespace for
    Tycho code.
<dt><code>Concept Index</code>
<dd>This opens an index browser for the master index to Tycho documentation.
    This is the most useful item in this menu for regular users.
<dt><code>Code Index</code>
<dd>This opens an index browser that accesses the Tycho source code.
    This is useful to code developers using Tycho for its primary
    purpose: as infrastructure for application development.
    The index points to the documentation (which is automatically
    generated from comments in the source code) for all classes,
    methods, and procedures.
<dt><code>Itcl Man pages</code>
<dd>This opens the Itcl man pages.  Itcl2.2 includes HTML format manpages 
    in <CODE>itcl2.2/html</CODE>.  This <CODE>Help</CODE> menu choice merely
    opens up
    <A HREF="itclhtml/TclTkMainList.html"><CODE>$TYCHO/itclhtml/TclTkMainList.html</CODE></A>.
    The Tycho installer should make links to their local Itcl man pages.

<dt><code>Style Preferences</code>
<dd>This is not really a <CODE>Help</CODE> item.  It opens the Tycho
    preference manager, which permits users to customize the appearance of
    Tycho. 
<dt><code>Class Diagram</code>
<dd>This opens a pictorial representation of the classes that make
    up the Tycho system, arranged according to their inheritance
    hierarchy.  The nodes in the diagram are hyperlinks to the
    documentation for the classes.  The source code for the classes
    can also be accessed using the pop-up menu (usually invoked by the
    right mouse button).
