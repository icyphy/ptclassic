<h1>Tycho's default layout</a></h1>
<p>

This is the standard layout of a full Tycho installation.  If you
install Tycho together with a number of packages, then you will get a
subset of this layout. You can also install the Tycho meta-package
only, and then add individual packages to the directory as you see
fit. In this case, you can place packages anywhere you like, as long
as the package searcher can find them.

<p>In the standard installation, packages are not installed in the
top-level directory, but underneath sub-directories called
<b>kernel/</b>, <b>editors/</b>, <b>utils/</b>. This provides for
manageable growth in the number of packages.  The structure of each
package is given in <a href="structure.html">Package structure</a>.

<p>By convention, each package that is a proper part of Tycho
has the name <b>tycho.<i>pkg</i></b>, where <b><i>pkg</i></b>
is the name of the directory in which it lives. For example,
the GUI kernel package is named <b>tycho.gui</b>. Packages
that are not part of Tycho proper, such as some of those in
the <b>utils</b> directory, have simple names, such as
<b>obstcl</b>.

 <P>Note that you do <B>not</B> need to install the Tycho
framework to use Tycho packages. As long as you have all the
packages you require, you can install them in your own
directories in any way you choose.
