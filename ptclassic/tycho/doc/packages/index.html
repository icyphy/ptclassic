<h1>Tycho's Package System</a></h1>
<p>

Tycho is structured as a set of Tcl packages. The package system is a
simple extension to the Tcl package mechanism to support nested
packages.  It is intended to make extending Tycho easier (by adding a
new package) and creating custom subsets possible (by removing
unwanted packages). If desired, Tycho can also be used as an
environment for creating independently-releasable and installable
packages.
