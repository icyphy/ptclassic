<h1>How to use a package</a></h1>
<p>

In general, using a package is simple: just call <code>package
require</code> with the package name as argument. However, things are not
quite that simple, as a) the package has to be known to Tcl, and b)
you have to make sure that you are requiring the right package.
Mostly, this is tricky only if you are writing stand-alone
applications that use portions of Tycho.

<h2>Packages that need packages, are the happiest packages...</h2>

Let's assume that you have created a new package (see <a
href="create.html">How to create a new package</a>). This package
uses one or more of the other Tycho packages, such as, say,
the <code>tycho.kernel.gui</code> package. All you need to do is ensure
that your package load script contains the line:

<pre>
  package require tycho.kernel.gui
</pre>

For robustness, you should specify the version number, so that
anyone that tries to use your package with an old version
of <code>tycho.kernel.gui</code> will get an error message:

<pre>
  package require tycho.kernel.gui 2.0
</pre>

Now, <code>tycho.kernel.gui</code> depends on functionality defined in
<code>tycho.kernel.basic</code> and <code>tycho.kernel.model</code>.
Don't worry about it:
as long as <code>tycho.kernel.gui</code> has a properly constructed
package load file, you will get these as well. In other words,
you only have to "require" the packages that you know you
are interested in.

<p>
As another example, suppose that you had an application
that used an HTML viewer and the Slate canvas package. Your
package load file would in that case contain:
<pre>
  package require tycho.kernel.html
  package require tycho.edit.slate
</pre>

 <P> If your package contains optional GUI functionality but might be
run from a non-graphical Tcl shell, then you can use something like
this:

<pre>
  # Only load the graphical packages only if running with Tk
  if [info exists tk_version] {
      package require tycho.kernel.gui
      package require tycho.kernel.html
  } else {
      package require tycho.kernel.basic
  }
</pre>

<h2>Packages that require Tycho proper</h2>

If you have written a package and you want to run as a part of the
Tycho <i>application</i> (as opposed to running your own application
that uses bits of Tycho), then call the procedure
<code>::tycho::start</code> in your start-up script. This procedure
accepts a bunch of arguments that tell is whether to show a splash
screen, whether to start with a console, and so on. You need to do
this after requiring <code>tycho.kernel.gui</code> or
<code>tycho.kernel</code>, and any other packages you might need.

<p>If your application really depends on all of Tycho, you
can simply go
<pre>
  package require tycho
</pre>

before calling  <code>::tycho::start</code>, and every single
package installed in your Tycho installation will be loaded.

<h2>Command-line scripts</h2>

Command-line scripts are a little tricky, because Tcl has such a lame
package mechanism. The problem is that, in order to find a package,
Tcl has to know what directories to look for packages in -- and what
it does is look in the directories in the <code>auto_path</code>
variable.

<p>So how does <code>auto_path</code> get set? Why, by your Tcl
code...  Actually, it isn't that bad, but because there is no standard
way of telling Tcl where to look for packages, shell scripts that run
Tcl need to go through some contortions to find the packages they
need.

<p>The first and simplest way of having Tcl find packages is to
install the package in the Tcl library directory. Tcl knows where that
is, at least, and initializes <code>auto_path</code> to contain it. If
you can't install there (because you don't have directory write
access, for example), then you have to rely on environment variables
(see <a href="install.html">Where to install a package</a>). Here is a
typical startup script; in the following, <I>pkg</I> is the package
tail in lowercase, <I>PKG</I> is the package tail in uppercase and
<I>Package</I> is the full package name. For example, if the package
is <CODE>tycho.util.tydoc</CODE>, then <I>pkg</I> is
<CODE>tydoc</CODE>, <I>PKG</I> is <CODE>TYDOC</CODE>, and
<I>Package</I> is <CODE>tycho.util.tydoc</CODE>.

<pre>
#! /bin/sh
# Command-line program for the <I>Package</I> utility \
    exec itclsh "$0" "$@"

# Author: <I>author</I>

# Create the tycho namespace
namespace ::tycho

# Set up the auto_path. What we do here is simply append
# paths to the auto_path in the order that is likely to
# be most rapid for finding the needed packages. Note that
# it is important to append all possible paths before doing
# a package require, in case this package requires other
# packages.

# Try <I>PKG</I>_LIBRARY
if [info exists env(<I>PKG</I>_LIBRARY)] {
    if { [lsearch -exact $auto_path $env(<I>PKG</I>_LIBRARY)] }  {
	lappend auto_path $env(<I>PKG</I>_LIBRARY)
    }
}

# Try TCL_PACKAGES
if [info exists env(TCL_PACKAGES)] {
    if { [lsearch -exact $auto_path $env(TCL_PACKAGES)] == -1 }  {
	lappend auto_path $env(TCL_PACKAGES)
    }
}

# Try TYCHO, or PTOLEMY if there is no TYCHO
if ![info exists env(TYCHO)] {
    if [info exists env(PTOLEMY)] {
	# TYCHO is not set, but PTOLEMY is.
	if [file exists [file join $env(PTOLEMY) tycho]] {
	    set env(TYCHO) [file join $env(PTOLEMY) tycho]
	}
    } 
}
if [info exists env(TYCHO)] {
    if { [lsearch -exact $auto_path $env(TYCHO)] == -1 }  {
	lappend auto_path $env(TYCHO)
    }
}

# Try loading the package. If it doesn't work, print a helpful
# error message and exit
if [catch {package require <I>Package</I>} err] {
    puts "Cannot load \"<I>Package</I>\"\
	    Error was:\n--start--\n$errorInfo\n--end--\n\
	    The auto_path variable lists the directories that were searched.\n\
	    auto_path = $auto_path\n\
	    You can:\n\
	    1. Install <I>Package</I> in a subdirectory of your \
	    Tcl library\n\
	    2. Install <I>Package</I> in the directory given by the \
	    TCL_PACKAGES variable\n\
	    3. Set the <I>PKG</I>_LIBRARY variable to point to the \
	    <I>pkg</I> directory\n\
	    4. Set the TYCHO variable to point to your \
	    Tycho installation\n\
	    5. Set the PTOLEMY variable to point to your \
	    Ptolemy installation\n"
    exit
}

# Print startup sig
puts "<I>Package</I>, version 1.0"

# Run the main procedure
eval <I>pkg</I> $argv

# Done
