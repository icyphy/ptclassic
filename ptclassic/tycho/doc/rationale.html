<p>
Theoreticians typically strive for simplicity, looking for the smallest
set of primitives on which they can build a general methodology.
In computer science theory, for example, numerous languages have
been devised that reflect this ideal by providing in a few primitives
an expressive power at least equivalent to Turing machines.
Practitioners view such efforts the way they view Turing machines: they
make an interesting abstraction, but they don't tell us much about how
to build systems. To a practitioner, the value of a language lies in
its utility, and both excessive simplicity and excessive complexity can
interfere with its utility.
<p>
This tension between theorists and practitioners is healthy, and the
best solutions emerge from compromise. But a major risk in compromise
is "creeping featurism." In an effort to win the broadest support,
features and options are added to a language until all semblance of
simplicity has been lost. Usually, however, these features have
merit. Their advocates can cite numerous applications, and win their
acceptance through compelling arguments about the utility of the
features.
<p>
A reasonable way to balance the pressures of breadth and simplicity is
to support heterogeneity. Failure to do so has doomed some otherwise
laudable efforts. For example, Common Lisp did not initially
define a "foreign
function interface," presumably because everything could be done in
Lisp. Practitioners, who built Common Lisp systems, realized that this
was not a practical approach, and built their own, mutually
incompatible foreign function interfaces. As a result, Lisp systems
were only interchangeable if programs used no foreign functions. And
few significant programs qualified. Standardization failed.
<p>
Small, specialized languages and tools are useful. For example, the
programming language embodied in a typical spreadsheet program is
extremely useful. But it is certainly not general, in that there are
many applications for which it is inappropriate. Such tools are
therefore most useful if they can be combined with other specialized
tools. Each tool is developed independently, making the development
effort manageably small. But by embedding the tool in an environment
with appropriate interfaces between tools, the utility of the tool is
greatly magnified. 
<p>
Looser integration of diverse capabilities has numerous advantages:
<p>
<ul>

<li>Existing, familiar tools do not need to be discarded in favor of a
new, all-encompassing tool. This is particularly valuable when
expertise with complex tools has built up over time.

<li>Capabilities can come in "bite sized" modules, making them easier
to learn, and rendering them more acceptable a conservative clientele.

<li>Tools from different vendors can be mixed, drawing from the
strengths of each.

<li>Competition among vendors is enhanced because fewer customers are
"locked in". This results in better tools at lower prices.

<li>Innovative tools with specialized capabilities have a market. They
do not need to be all-encompassing to be salable. So innovation is
encouraged.
</ul>
<p>
There are also significant disadvantages:
<p>
<ul>

<li>User interfaces are likely to be different with different tools,
making them more difficult to learn.

<li>Integration may not be complete. For example, once a design is
migrated from one tool to another, without tight integration, it may be
difficult to back annotate the original design. More basic failures of
interoperability are also likely.
</ul> 
<p>

We believe that with system level design problems, the advantages
outweigh the disadvantages. The Ptolemy project aims to ameliorate the
disadvantages. The Ptolemy software system, which has been under
development at U.C. Berkeley since 1990, addresses the problem of
mixing "models of computation", or semantic models. The Tycho software
system, under development since 1995 as a part of the Ptolemy project,
addresses the problem of mixing syntactic models. For example, while
Ptolemy can support mixtures of discrete-event and dataflow modeling,
Tycho can support mixtures of textual and graphical syntaxes.

<p>

In both Ptolemy and Tycho, the goals are accomplished through a
strict and carefully designed object-oriented software architecture.
A key principal is that of "information hiding".  Objects should
be able to interact with one another without knowing about either
their internal semantic or syntactic models.
