<DT> <A NAME="Tycho description (short)"><B>1.1 What Is Tycho?</B></A>

<DD> At first glance, Tycho is a extensible Itcl development
environment.  We are developing Tycho to use it as a GUI for the
Ptolemy Project.  Tycho is a work in progress, but others my find
it useful as is.

<DT> <A NAME="Tycho feature list"><B>1.2 What features does Tycho have?</B></A>
<DD> The two primary features that Itcl developers will find interesting
are the Itcl profiler and the graphical class browser.  Other features
include:

<MENU>
<LI> Integrated HTML-based documentation system, including automatic
	generation of HTML documentation from Itcl files.

<LI> A canvas interface with grouped objects.

<LI> An Emacs-like syntax-sensitive text editors (with considerably more
         than the Tk text widget).

<LI> Tcl/Itcl interactive shell.

<LI> Widget library, including:
    	<MENU>
	<LI> file browser
	<LI> spell checker (Unix only)
	<LI> font selector
	<LI> preference system (partially constructed)
	<LI> index browser
	<LI> configurable dialog widgets
	<LI> interface to RCS and SCCS version control (Unix only)
	<LI> simple color browser
	<LI> HTML-formatted message widgets
	<LI> error handler with stack trace display
	<LI> graph display with auto-layout for directed acyclic graphs
	<LI> tree structure display with collapsible subtrees
	<LI> bubble and arc graph editor
	<LI> interface to glimpse (Unix only)
	</MENU>


<LI> Base classes and widgets for construction of other applications:
	<MENU>
	<LI> view/displayer architecture
	<LI> font manager
	<LI> menu bar
	<LI> status bar
	<LI> tool bar
	<LI> subpanel
	<LI> file system interface
	<LI> text editor widget
	</MENU>
</MENU>


<DT> <A NAME="itcl description"><B>1.6 What Is Itcl?</B></A>
<DD> Itcl is short hand for [incr Tcl]which is an object
oriented version of the Tool Command Language (tcl).  Tcl was written
by John Ousterhout of U.C. Berkeley and Sun Labs, Itcl was written by
Michael McLennan of Lucent.  For more information about Itcl,
including a PostScript tutorial, see the Itcl homepage at <A
HREF="http://www.tcltk.com"><CODE>http://www.tcltk.com</CODE></A>.

<DT> <A NAME="ptolemy description"><B>1.7 What is Ptolemy?</B></A>
<DD> Ptolemy is a software package that is used to design signal
processing and communications systems, ranging from designing and
simulating algorithms to synthesizing hardware and software,
parallelizing algorithms, and prototyping real-time systems.

 <P>Ptolemy is written in C++, and uses Tcl/Tk and the X Window System.
See <A
HREF="http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu"><CODE>http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu</CODE></A> for further information.

<DT> <A NAME="astronomy"><B>1.8 Who was Tycho Brahe?</B></A>
<DD> Tycho Brahe was an astronomer, the Tycho documentation includes a
brief <A HREF="brahe.html">biography</A>.

</DL>

<H2><A NAME="faq: installation"><B>2. Installation questions</B></A></H2>
<DL>

<DT> <A NAME="downloading Tycho"><B>2.1 How do I download Tycho?</B></A>
<DD> <A HREF="http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/tycho/Tycho.html"><CODE>http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/tycho/Tycho.html</CODE></A> has instructions and Itcl binaries.

<DT> <A NAME="platforms that Tycho runs under"><B>2.2 What platforms does Tycho run under?</B></A>
<DD> We do our development work under Solaris2.5.1, and we've tested Tycho
under HPUX10.20 and SunOS4.x.  Tycho should work under any Unix platform
that Itcl runs under.

 <P>Tycho has been run
under WindowsNT, but some of the features that use <CODE>exec</CODE> are
broken.
 <P> The Macintosh port requires Itcl2.2p2, the prebuilt Itcl2.2
binaries will not work.  The Macintosh port is basically untested.


<DT> <A NAME="installation, what do I need"><B>2.3 What do I need to Install Tycho?</B></A>
<DD> 
	<MENU>
	<LI> Tycho 0.2 uses Itcl2.2
	<MENU>
	<LI> You can download Itcl2.2 Windows binaries from 
	<A HREF="http://www.tcltk.com"><CODE>http://www.tcltk.com</CODE></A>

	<LI> Solaris2, SunOs and HPUX 10.x binaries can be obtained
	from <A HREF="http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu"><CODE>http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu</CODE></A>

	<LI> On the Macintosh, Tycho 0.2 requires Itcl2.2p2.
	</MENU>

	<LI> To use the Tcljava interface, you will need JDK 1.1.1, which
	can be downloaded from <A HREF="http://www.javasoft.com"><CODE>http://www.javasoft.com</CODE></A>.  Tcljava has been built on Solaris2.5.1, 
	and Windows NT4.0.

	<LI> To use the Tcl Profiler, you will need the Tcl sources, as
	the C file that implements the <CODE>profile</CODE> command
	requires tclInt.h

	<LI> To use TkSteal, you will need the Tk sources.  TkSteal
	sources are not shipped with Tycho.
	</MENU>




<DT> <A NAME="troubleshooting overview"><B>2.4 Troubleshooting</B></A>
<DD> The <A HREF="troubleshooting.html">Tycho Troubleshooting</A> guide
has a few hints.

 <P>You might find useful information on the Tycho homepage at
<A HREF="http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/tycho"><CODE>http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/tycho</CODE></A>.

 <P>If you are really stumped, you can send mail to <A
HREF="mailto:tycho@eecs.berkeley.edu"><CODE>tycho@eecs.berkeley.edu</CODE></A>.
Your mail should include:
<OL>
<LI> What version of Tycho you are running.
<LI> What platform you are running under (Solaris, Windows etc.)
<LI> Exactly how to reproduce the bug.
<LI> A Tcl backtrace, if appropriate.
</OL>

<H2><A NAME="faq: why didn't you . . . ">3. Why didn't you . . .</A>
</H2>

<DL>
<DT> <A NAME="emacs"><B>3.1 Why didn't you just use Emacs?</B></A>
<DD> FSF Emacs is not particularly graphical, though Xemacs is better.
We want to be able to have active graphical widgets intermingled with text.

<DT> <A NAME="iwidgets"><B>3.2 Why didn't you use the Iwidgets widgets
everywhere?</B></A>

<DD> 

Tycho uses a different model for mapping widgets to the screen.  In
particular, widgets are completely constructed, and then actively
mapped to the screen.  Unlike Iwidgets, which map partially
constructed widgets, Tycho widgets can be centered on the screen and
sized according to screen dimensions.  We could not find a way to use
Iwidgets without sacrificing these features.

<P>
This was a design decision made by the Tycho authors.  In some
cases, we decided to use a simpler widget.  In other cases the
functionality we needed was missing.  We also wanted the widget we
wrote to use some of the features of Tycho, such as automatically
generated documentation and active Tcl examples.

<DT> <A NAME="java, instead of Itcl"><B>3.3 Why didn't you use Java?</B></A>
<DD> When we started Tycho, Java was still very new.  Currently, we
don't know of a good canvas like Java class like the Tk canvas.  We'd
rather not reinvent the wheel here and write our own Java canvas.

 <P> Also, we wanted to be able to provide an easily extensible
environment for non-programmers, which makes an interpreted language
such as Tcl a stronger candidate than a compiled language such as
Java.
 <P> Tycho does include a version of Sun's Tcljava interface and we are
looking into using Tcl and Java together.  For more information, see the
Tycho<A HREF="../java/doc/index.html">Java </A> page.
