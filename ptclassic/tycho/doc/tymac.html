<P>The prebuilt Itcl2.2 Macintosh binaries will not work with Tycho0.2beta.
Tycho0.2 will work with an as-yet unreleased version of Itcl2.2p2 on the Mac.
We do not know if or when Itcl2.2p2 on the Mac will be released.

<MENU>

<LI> Tycho 0.1.1 did not work under Itcl2.2 apparently because when Tycho
started up the stack size was so large that it crashed the Mac.  With
Itcl2.2p2, Tycho 0.1.1 and Tycho 0.2 both seem to work.

<LI> Tycho0.2 does not handle spaces in pathnames very well.  Tycho
will work best if the distribution is installed in a directory that
has a pathname that contains no spaces.

<LI> Since the Mac has different filename conventions, not all the filename
 facilities work properly. See the Tcl <CODE>filename</CODE> man page
for information about pathnames on the Mac.


<LI> Cascade menus under Itcl2.2p2 and under Tk4.2 on the Mac seem to
be broken.  It is very difficult to use the mouse on a cascade menu,
such as <CODE>File</CODE> -&gt; <CODE>Tools</CODE>.  The workaround is
to use the <CODE>Up</CODE>, <CODE>Down</CODE> and Arrow keys to invoke
menu choices.

<LI> Starting Tycho requires sourcing <CODE>$TYCHO/lib/mac/tycho-mac</CODE>
script by hand.  There must be a better way.

<LI> Tycho on the Mac should use an installer.

<LI> The Tycho home page at <A
HREF="http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/tycho/Tycho.html"><CODE>http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/tycho/Tycho.html</CODE></A> has a
link to the downloads page that contains Tycho sources.
When Itcl2.2p2 is released, it will be available on that page as well.

<LI> Download both the Tycho distribution and the Itcl distribution and
place them in directories next to each other.  For example,
<MENU>
<LI>  The Tycho distribution could be in <CODE>mac:devel:tycho0.2</CODE>

<LI>  The Itcl distribution could be in <CODE>mac:devel:Itk2.2p2-ppc</CODE>
</MENU>


<LI> Install Itcl by following the instructions in the <CODE>README-mac</CODE>
file.

<LI> Move the <CODE>tycho-mac</CODE> script from
<CODE>tycho0.1.1:lib:mac</CODE> to the top level Itcl directory.  In
this example, <CODE>tycho-mac</CODE> would end up at
<CODE>mac:devel:itcl2.2-ppc:tycho-mac</CODE>.

<LI> To start up Tycho, start <CODE>Itkwish</CODE>, then type
<CODE>source tycho-mac</CODE>.

<LI> Tycho includes HTML documentation of the Itcl classes that make up
Tycho.  To save space, these files are not shipped in the Tycho tar
file, you must build them after untarring the distribution.

 <P>The
<A HREF="../kernel/doc/usersGuides/BuilderDialogHelp.html">BuilderDialog</A>
is an experimental graphical interface to the build process.  The
BuilderDialog interface will change over time, but you may find it useful
for building the HTML documentation.  To run the BuilderDialog, choose the
<CODE>Build Tycho</CODE> submenu choice under the <CODE>Tools</CODE> menu
choice in the main <CODE>Window</CODE> menu.

 <P>Under Unix, the best way to build these files is to run
<CODE>make install</CODE>.  However, under Windows, a <CODE>make</CODE>
binary may or may not be present, so running the BuilderDialog
is usually the best option.
