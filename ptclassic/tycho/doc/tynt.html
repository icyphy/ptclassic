<h1>Tycho under Microsoft Windows</h1>
The Microsoft Windows port of Tycho is fairly young, so there are
plenty of bugs.  The only testing of this port was done under NT4.0,
so Windows3.1 and Windows95 users may have other problems.

<LI> Tycho0.2.1 does not handle spaces in pathnames very well.  Tycho
will work best if the distribution is installed in a directory that
has a pathname that contains no spaces.

<LI> It would be nice if the installation was such that a Windows user could
just mouse on a Tycho icon and then Tycho would come up.

<LI> Don't use Itcl2.1 under Windows, it does not support removing
files and making directories.  If you use Itcl2.1, then Tycho
<CODE>exec</CODE>s <CODE>rm</CODE> or <CODE>mkdir</CODE>, which fail
under Windows.  Instead of using Itcl2.1 under Windows, use the
Itcl2.2 binaries.

<LI> Because of differences in the end-of-line characters between Unix
and Windows, it appears that Tcl scripts edited with the NT
<CODE>Notebook</CODE> program cannot be sourced with Itcl2.2.

<LI> If you run <CODE>nmake</CODE> from within the Tycho Monitor, then
any submakes will bring up new windows, and the <CODE>nmake</CODE> output
will be lost.

<H2>Installing Tycho Under NT</H2>
<OL>
<LI> The Tycho home page at <A
HREF="http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/tycho/Tycho.html"><CODE>http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/tycho/Tycho.html</CODE></A> has a
link to the downloads page that contains Tycho sources and Itcl
binaries for Windows.


<LI> Install Itcl by running <CODE>itcl22.exe</CODE>.

<LI> Because of a bug in Itcl2.2, the path leading up to the
<CODE>tycho.0.2.1/lib/windows/tycho-windows.itk</CODE> script cannot
have any spaces in it.  If you installed Tycho in <CODE>c:\Program
Files</CODE>, then you must move either
<CODE>c:\Program Files\tycho0.2.1\ </CODE> or the
<CODE>tycho0.2.1\lib\windows\tycho-window.itk</CODE> script to a
directory that has no spaces in the pathname leading up to it.  It is
best if you move the entire Tycho distribution to
<CODE>c:\tycho0.2.1</CODE>.


<LI> There are two ways to start up Tycho:
<DL>
<DT> <A HREF="DOS batch file: tycho.bat"><CODE>$TYCHO/bin/tycho.bat</CODE></A>
<DD> A DOS batch file which can can be used as
<MENU>
<LI> <CODE>tycho</CODE>

<LI> <CODE>tycho <I>filename</I></CODE>

</MENU>


<DT> <CODE>$TYCHO/lib/windows/tycho-windows.itk</CODE>
<DD> An <CODE>itk</CODE> file that can be started up by <CODE>itkwish</CODE>
if your system is setup up properly.

</DL>
We discuss the details below.


<LI> Tycho refers to the directory where the Tycho distribution is
with the environment variable <CODE>$TYCHO</CODE>.  In Unix, under
<CODE>csh</CODE>, you would do something like <CODE>setenv TYCHO
/usr/local/tycho</CODE>.

 <P> You can either hardwire this variable by setting it in the
<CODE>tycho-windows</CODE> or 
<CODE>tycho.bat</CODE> start up scripts, or under
NT, you can set the <CODE>TYCHO</CODE> environment variable by
clicking on <CODE>Start</CODE>, then <CODE>Settings</CODE>, then
<CODE>Control Panel</CODE> and finally the <CODE>System</CODE> icon.
In the <CODE>System Properties</CODE> window that comes up, select
<CODE>Environment</CODE>.  There, you can add <CODE>TYCHO</CODE> as a
User Variable.  Incidentally, this is where you set your path.

 <P> If your Tycho distribution is at <CODE>c:\tycho0.2.1</CODE>, then
you need not set the <CODE>TYCHO</CODE> environment variable, it will
be set for you, by the <CODE>tycho-windows</CODE> script.  If your
distribution is elsewhere, then you must either set the
<CODE>TYCHO</CODE> variable, or edit
<CODE>tycho0.2.1/lib/windows/tycho-windows</CODE>.

<LI> <CODE>tycho0.2.1/lib/windows/tycho-windows</CODE>
and <CODE>tycho.bat</CODE>
first check the <CODE>TYCHO</CODE> variable, and if
<CODE>TYCHO</CODE> is not set, then the script expects that the Tycho
distribution will be at <CODE>c:\tycho0.2.1</CODE>.

<LI> Itcl2.2 associates files with the <CODE>itk</CODE> extension with
the <CODE>itkwish</CODE> binary.  Apparently, the <CODE>itk</CODE>
files must have Unix style end-of-line characters.

<P> To start Tycho, click on the
<CODE>tycho0.2.1/lib/windows/tycho-windows.itk</CODE> script
or add <CODE>%tycho%\bin</CODE> to your path and run <CODE>tycho</CODE>
from the DOS prompt.

<LI> Tycho includes HTML documentation of the Itcl classes that make up
Tycho.  In Tycho0.2.1, these files are shipped with the Tycho distribution.
