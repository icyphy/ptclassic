<H1>The Slate demos</H1>

<br>
The Slate comes with a set of demo scripts that show
off some of its features. To run the demos, do the following:

<ul>

<li>Change to the <B>demo</B> directory of the <B>slate</B>
directory.

<li>Run the <B>demo</B> script with the demo name
as an argument. For example,

<pre>
    ./demo LabeledLine
</pre>

 <P>
If you don't have <B>bash</B>, then you can do this instead:

<pre>
    wish80
</pre>

and in the <B>wish</B> shell, do
<pre>
    set argv LabeledLine
    source demo
</pre>

<li> To run all demos, just do

<pre>
    ./demo
</pre>

 <P>
or in <B>wish</B>,

<pre>
    source demo
</pre>

</ul>

(You can run the test suites in a similar way. Change
to the <B>test</B> directory and execute, for example,
<pre>
    ./test Frame
</pre>

or

<pre>
    ./test
</pre>

 <P>
The demos are:

<dl>
 <P>
<dt><B>Animator</B>

<dd> A neat animation demo. The demo simply creates two
items and moves and reshapes them. Note the way that the
animation of the two items is synchronized at the end of
each sequence.

 <P>
<dt><B>Binding</B>

<dd> A demo that shows how binding works on the presence of
hierarchy. It brings up two items: one contains child items that do
not handle events, and the other contains child items that handle
events. (By dragging on the different items you will see how this
works.)


 <P>
<dt><B>Grapple</B>

<dd> A demo that illustrates how to have selected items have
grab-handles for reshaping. Drag the items to move them; drag the
grab-handles to reshape them.


 <P>
<dt><B>LabeledLine</B>

<dd>
A demo of the LabeledLine item type, which attempt to
keep a label near the middle of a multi-segment line.
Drag the blue grab-handles to move the lines around.

 <P>
<dt><B>Paper1</B>
<br><B>Paper2</B>

<dd>
A couple of demos that were used to create images for
the '98 Tcl/Tk conference paper. You can drag the items
around with the mouse.

 <P>
<dt><B>Selection1</B>
<br><B>Selection2</B>

<dd> A couple of demos illustrating the configurability of the Selector
interactor. All items except the arrow can be selected and dragged
around. Drag on the background for rubber-banding selection; use
shift-click and shift-drag to toggle items.  In Selection1, a text
item that is already selected will become editable when it is clicked
again.  In Selection2, a text item will be editable if clicked on, but
will be moved if rubber-band-selected and then clicked on (the
FrameMaker model).

 <P>
<dt><B>SmartLine</B>

<dd> A demo of the SmartLine item type, which reshapes itself so make
a best-guess at how to connect to points with perpendicular lines.
Drag the green diamond with the mouse to see the different shapes.
The radio buttons at the bottom select the direction the line comes
into the diamond.

 <P>
<dt><B>Widget</B>

<dd> A simple demo illustrating how the Slate and its interactors can
be used to construct a custom widget. This is a very simple
version of the Slider widget, and is kept short for inclusion
in the Tcl/Tk '98 conference paper.
