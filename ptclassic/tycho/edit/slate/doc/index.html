 <P>

The Slate is an [incr Tcl] megawidget layered over the Tcl/Tk canvas.
It contains features that we believe to be necessary or useful for
implementing complex graphical editing and visualization widgets.  The
key features of the Slate are:

<dl>
<dt>A visual hierarchy

<dd> The Slate implements a straight-forward visual hierarchy, as is
common in many graphics packages. We are able to define new kinds of
graphical items that are composed of simpler items. All of the canvas
methods are rewritten to handle hierarchical items.

 <P>
<dt>Item shapes

<dd> Every item has a shape, such as <i>point</i>, <i>rectangle</i>,
<i> polygon</i>, or a custom-designed shape. Items can be queried for
the coordinates of an <i>aspect</i>, such as the north-east corner or
the second vertex. Items can be requested to move one or more aspects,
reshaping the item.

 <P><dt>Interactors

<dd> Event-handlers can be bound to any level of the visual
hierarchy. In addition, we implemented a more abstract and much more
powerful user interaction framework, in which a particular sequence of
user interactions is abstracted into objects called
<i>interactors</i>.

</dl>

The Slate also contains other useful methods, such as highlighting and
selection. Documentation available:

<dl>
<dt><A HREF="tutorial/index.html">A short tutorial</A>

<dd> If
you are reading this in the Tycho HTML browser, you can double-click
on the Tcl code to execute it. Otherwise, you can copy and
paste, or just read it.

<dt><A HREF="internals/index.html">The programmer's guide</A>

<dd> A somewhat-disorganized guide to the internals of the Slate,
the available classes and features, and a programmer's
FAQ.

<dt><A HREF="codeDoc/index.html">Class documentation</A>

<dd> Documentation for the Slate classes, generated from the source
code by the <CODE>tydoc</CODE> utility.

 <P>The downloads available are:

<dl>

<dt><A HREF="distribution.html">The distribution page</A>

<dd>The unofficial disribution of the Slate. This contains the
latest unreleased version of the Slate and supporting software.

<dt><A

<dd>This is the official release of Tycho, which includes the Slate.
The official release is very out of date.
