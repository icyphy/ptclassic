<p>
This release: <b>3.0 alpha</b>. See also the
<a href="internals/bugs.html">Bugs and Caveats</a> page.

 <P>
The Tycho Slate is a Tcl/Tk package that implements a useful layer of
abstraction over the regular Tk canvas. The Slate is part of the Tycho
user interface system, but can be installed and used by itself as
well. It runs with either:

<ul>
<li> Tcl 8.0; or
<li> [incr Tcl] 3.0
</ul>

In the [incr Tcl] version, a slate is an [incr Tk] megawidget that
contains a Tk canvas. In the Tcl version, a slate is a "faked"
mega-widget, that can be invoked with an object-oriented style of
interface or a Tcl-like procedural style of interface.

<p>The Slate contains a number of features that we believe make the Tk
canvas more useful. We wrote it to help us implement graphical editors
and visualization widgets.  The key features of the Slate are:

<dl>
<dt>User-defined item types

<dd> You can define you own item types, which can be manipulated in
the same manner as regular canvas items. For example, in our graphical
editors we have items for icons, for "smart" self-routing lines, and
so on. Items can be composed into ever-more-complex items.

 <P>
<dt>Shapes and features

<dd> We added a neat feature to all items (canvas and user-defined).
Each item has a shape, such as <i>point</i>, <i>rectangle</i>, <i>
polygon</i>, or a custom-designed shape. Items can be queried for the
coordinates of a <i>feature</i>, such as the north-east corner or the
second vertex.

 <P>
<dt>Events and interactors

<dd> Event scripts can be bound to user-defined items just as for
regular canvas items. We also added a new kind of interaction
technique called <i>interactors</i>.  For instance, say you want to
make an item draggable with the mouse -- all you do is create a
Follower interactor and attach it to the item or a tag, and the
event-binding is all done for you.

</dl>

The Slate also contains other useful methods, such as item
highlighting, selection, and so on.  To see an example of an editor
and some widgets created with the Slate, see the <A

time simulation demo</A> screen-shot page.

 <P>Documentation available:

<dl>
<dt><A HREF="install.html">Installation</A>

<dd> How to download and install the Slate. If you already have Tycho
installed, then everything should be running already, but you might
like to check this page if you have problems running the demos.

<dt><A HREF="demos.html">The Slate demos</A>

<dd> An overview of the Slate demo programs, and how to run them. The
demos show off some of the features of the Slate and might also be a
useful source of example code.

<dt><A HREF="tutorial/index.html">A short tutorial</A>

<dd> An interactive tutorial on the Slate. If you read this in the
Tycho HTML browser, you can double-click on the Tcl code to execute
it. Otherwise, you can copy and paste, type, or just read!

<dt><A HREF="internals/index.html">The programmer's guide</A>

<dd> A guide to the internals of the Slate, the available classes and
features, and a programmer's FAQ.

<dt><A HREF="codeDoc/index.html">Class documentation</A>

<dd> Documentation for the Slate classes, generated from the source
code by the <CODE>tydoc</CODE> utility.

<dt><A HREF="sources/">Source code</A>
