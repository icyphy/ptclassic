<H1>Installation</H1>
<br>
If you are running the Slate from within Tycho,
then you shouldn't need to do anything more. Otherwise,
read on. We assume that you already have [incr Tcl] 3.0
or Tcl 8.0 installed and know how to run it.

<p>
Note that the Slate has been tested only under Solaris
and Windows NT. It should work as advertised on other platforms,
but we haven't tried it.

If you are running [incr Tcl] 3.0, you only need the
<b>slate</b> package itself. If you are running Tcl 8.0,
you also need to get the <b>obstcl</b> package.


<dl>

<dt><b>slate</b>

<dd>This is the slate package itself. It contains everything
you need if you are running [incr Tcl] 3.0.

<ul>

<li><A
HREF="dist/slate.zip"><code>slate.zip</code></A>

<li><A
HREF="dist/slate.tar.gz"><code>slate.tar.gz</code></A>

</ul>

 <P>
<dt><b>obstcl</b>

<dd><b>obstcl</b> is a simple Tcl-only object-oriented layer
for Tcl. You need this to run the Slate with Tcl 8.0.

<ul>
<li><A HREF="../obstcl/dist/obstcl.zip"><code>obstcl.zip</code></A>
<li><A HREF="../obstcl/dist/obstcl.tar.gz"><code>obstcl.tar.gz</code></A>
</ul>

</dl>

 <P>These instructions assume that you do not already have
Tycho installed.

<ol>

<li>Download the packages you need into a suitable directory.  This is
either the <b>lib</b> directory of your Tcl or [incr Tcl]
installation, or some other directory where you put Tcl packages. To
see what the lib directory is, start <b>itclsh</b> or <b>tclsh</b> and
type:

<pre>
    file dirname [info library]
</pre>

 <P>
<li>Change to that directory and do either:

<pre>
    unzip -a slate.zip
    unzip -a obstcl.zip
</pre>

 <P>or

<pre>
    gzcat slate.tar.gz | tar -xf -
    gzcat obstcl.tar.gz | tar -xf -
</pre>

 <P>If you are running under windows and have WinZip
installed, you can also double-click on the files.

 <P> <li> Make sure that the Tcl package loader will be able to find
these packages. If you didn't install them in the <b>lib</b> directory of
your Tcl installation, then I suggest that you set an environment
variable TCL_PACKAGES to the directory containing the two packages.
(This is needed for the demo and test scripts.)

<p>
<li> Fix the demo and test startup scripts. The second line
of these scripts will say something like
<pre>
    exec itkwish3.0 "$0" "$@"
</pre>

(Windows users: the following assumes you have <b>bash</b>
from Cygwin installed. If not, and you need a DOS batch file, send
me email).

<p>
Change the <b>itkwish3.0</b> to:

<ul>
<li><b>wish80</b>, to run Tcl 8.0 on Windows
<li><b>wish8.0</b>, to run Tcl 8.0 on Unix
<li><b>itkwish30</b>, to run [incr Tcl] 3.0 on Windows
<li><b>itkwish3.0</b>, to run [incr Tcl] 3.0 on Unix
</ul>

or to whatever alias or symbolic link you have for running
wish or itkwish.

</ol>


<p>
<a name="check">
<b>Check</b>
</a>

  <P>To verify the installation, start <b>wish</b> 8.0
or <b>itkwish</b> 3.0. If the Slate is not in your Tcl library
directory, go:

<pre>
  lappend auto_path $env(TCL_PACKAGES)
</pre>

Then go:
<pre>
  package require slate
</pre>

You should get "3.0". Then try:
<pre>
    ::tycho::slate .s
    pack .s
    raise .
    .s create Frame 50 50 100 100 -color green
</pre>
    
Any problems, send me email.

<P> Now you can try out the demos or run the tutorial.
When you use the Slate in your own programs, just be sure
to do

<pre>
    package require slate
</pre>

 <P>before trying to create a new Slate. 

<p>(Note to Tycho users: in Tycho, the
Slate package is called <b>tycho.edit.slate</b>.)
