<h1>Box-and-arrow items</h1>


<p>One of the main reasons for the existence of the Slate is because we 
want to be able to rapidly construct graphical editors for 
``box-and-arrow'' diagrams.  This is perhaps the most common structure 
present in visual languages and computer/software diagrams (followed by 
hierarchy), and includes all kinds of dataflow diagrams, state machines, 
flowcharts, class hierarchy diagrams, object models, dataflow-diagrams 
(as used in in structure analysis and design -- SA/SD), and circuit 
diagrams.  At present, the Slate only has some experimental item types
for these kinds of diagrams.

<h2><a name="Terminal item type"></a><a href="../codeDoc/Terminal.html">Terminal</a></h2>

<i>Terminal</i> is a line that represents a "terminal" on some graphical
object. Its coordinates are the coordinates at which it "connects" to 
whatever it is that it is a terminal of.

<p><b>Options</b>:

<ul>
<li><b>-direction</b>. The direction of the terminal away from its 
origin (the point at which it "connects" to something), as a unit 
vector. The "unit vector" is a Tcl list of two elements (x and y). The 
default is <b>{1 0}</b>, meaning that the terminal will be 
horizontal and drawn to connect to a node on its left, and to a wire 
on its right.

<li><b>-fill</b>. The color of the terminal. 

<li><b>-length</b>. The length of the line representing the terminal. 

<li><b>-style</b>.  The "style" of terminal: <i>arrow</i>, 
<i>doublearrow</i>, or <i>blob</i>.  If <i>arrow</i>, the terminal is 
just a simple arrow; if <i>doublearrow</i>, the arrow has two heads; if 
<i>blob</i>, the terminal has a small circle at the wiring end.

<li><b>-type</b>. The "type" of the terminal: <i>input</i> or 
<i>output</i>. This is mainly used to control the appearance of the 
terminal.

</ul>

<p><b>Enhancements</b>: The "arrow" style should perhaps put a
"tail" on the wiring end of an input terminal (as in VEM).

<p><b>Example</b>: Create some terminals:
<tcl quiet><pre>
  source $tycho/editors/slate/doc/internals/newslate.itcl
  foreach {x y opts} {
   	100 50  {}
   	100 100 {-type output -fill red}
   	100 150 {-style blob  -fill blue}
   	100 200 {-direction {1 1} -style doublearrow}
  } {
   	eval $slate create Terminal $x $y $opts
  }
</pre></tcl>


<h2><a name="SmartLine item type"></a><a href="../codeDoc/SmartLine.html">SmartLine</a></h2>

A <i>SmartLine</i> is a line item that is able to draw itself between 
two arbitrary points using only vertical and horizontal lines.  The 
coordinates are the two end-points of the line. The line 
needs to be told from what direction to approach each of its endpoints.

<p><b>Options</b>:

<dl>
<dt><dd>
<dl>
<dt><b>-alpha</b>
<dd>The minimum distance from an end-point of a line
to the first vertex.

<dt><b>-arrow</b>
<dd>The location of the arrow-head on the line: can be
one of <i>none</i>, <i>first</i>, <i>last</i>, or <i>both</i>. 
<i>none</i> by default.

<dt><b>-beta</b>
<dd>The preferred distance between vertices that "wrap" back
in the opposite direction.

<dt><b>-end</b>
<dd>The direction of the line end-point. Can be one of the
four major compass points: <i>n</i>, <i>s</i>, <i>e</i>, or <i>w</i>. It is
<i>e</i> by default.

<dt><b>-fill</b>
<dd>The color of the line. Black by default.

<dt><b>-smoothing</b>
<dd>The flag controlling whether the line is
drawn with curves instead of straight segments. Off by default.

<dt><b>-start</b>
<dd>The direction of the line start-point. Can be one of the
four major compass points: <i>n</i>, <i>s</i>, <i>e</i>, or <i>w</i>. It is
<i>e</i> by default.

</dl></dl>

 <P><b>Enhancements</b>

 <P>SmartLine needs to support "manual" 
dragging of line segments and vertices.

 <P><b>Example</b>

 <P>
<tcl quiet><pre>
  package require slate.demo
  ::demo::demoSmartLine
</pre></tcl>

<h2><a name="Node item type"></a><a href="../codeDoc/Node.html">Node</a></h2>

<i>Node</i> is an item that represents a node of a computation graph 
of some kind. It is fully parameterized: the way the node is drawn and 
the appearance of its terminals if given by configuration options. 
For a specific application, you may prefer to write an item type
dedicated to the application.

<p><b>Options</b>:

<ul>
<li><b>-font</b>. The font to use to display the textual name of the 
node. By default, this is a twelve-point Helvetica font.

<li><b>-icontype</b>. A list containing the item type to use to draw the
node, followed by options of the item. The item must accept exactly 
four coordinates, and is assumed in fact to be rectangular.
The default is <b>{Frame -color green}</b>, meaning that the 
icon will be a raised green pseudo-3D rectangle (not as bad as it 
sounds!).

<li><b>-inputs</b>.  The positions of the input connections.  This is a 
flat list of <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> coordinates, as percentages of the 
icon size and with the origin at the top left of the icon.  By default, 
this is <b>{0 50}</b>, meaning that there is a single input 
halfway up the left edge of the icon.  If a single integer is given when 
setting this option, the option is set to a list such that that number 
of inputs are evely spaced along the left edge of the icon.  For 
example, setting <b>-inputs 2</b> will result in the 
<b>-inputs</b> being set to <b>{0 25 0 75}</b>.

<li><b>-intype</b>.  A list containing the item type to use to draw the 
input terminals, followed by options of the item.  The item must accept 
exactly two coordinates.  The default is <b>{Terminal -type 
input}</b>.

<li><b>-name</b>.  The name of the node, which is displayed immediately 
underneath the node's icon.  The default is "NoName."

<li><b>-outputs</b>.  The positions of the output connections.  This is 
must the same as the <b>inputs</b> option, except that output 
terminals are by default placed at the right-hand side of the node icon.

<li><b>-outtype</b>.  A list containing the item type to use to draw the 
output terminals, followed by options of the item.  The default is 
<b>{Terminal -type output}</b>.

</ul>

<p><b>Enhancements</b>: In an earlier version of the Slate, Node items 
had primary and secondary "directions," so that you could flip the 
node about the vertical and horizontal axes.

<p><b>Caveats</b>: The current release has a serious bug in the way 
that tags and bindings to complex items that themselves contain complex 
items are handled. Because of this, dragging and resizing Nodes does 
not work.

<p><b>Example</b>: Create a node:
<tcl quiet><pre>
  source $tycho/editors/slate/doc/internals/newslate.itcl
  .t.s create Node 50 50 120 90 -inputs {0 50 50 0} -outputs 2 &#92
	-name Foo -tags moveable &#92
	-intype {Terminal -type input -style blob -fill red} &#92
	-outtype {Terminal -type output -style doublearrow -fill blue}
</pre></tcl>
