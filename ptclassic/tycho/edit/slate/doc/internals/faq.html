<h1>FAQ: tricks and pitfalls</h1>



<P> In theory, The Tycho IncrCanvas and Slate these classes are
upwards-compatible with the Tk canvas and are as easy to use as the Tk
canvas. In practice, however, it's not that simple, either because the
performance constraints of Tcl forced some short-cuts that
occasionally show up in the interface, or because we just
boo-booed. Here's a frank listing of possible problems and hard
questions that might come up, in no particular order.

<p>(For the sake of brevity, "Slate" means "the IncrCanvas and
Slate classes.")
<ol>

<p><li><b>Question</b>:
In my ComplexItem subclass, I created an item and gave
it a tag <b>$id.myitem</b>, and got some kind of
"item class not found" message. What's up?

<p><b>Answer</b>: The Slate uses the following tests to figure out if an
argument is a the ID of a simple (Tk canvas) item, a complex
item, or a tag (anything else):

<pre>
    if [string match {[0-9]*} $tag] {
        # $tag is a simple item
        ...
    } elseif [string match {_*} $tag] {
        # $tag is a complex item
        ...
    } else {
        # $tag is a tag
        ...
    }
</pre>

(Complex item IDs start with an underscore.)
We (i.e. Reekie, it's all his fault) did this
because we were concerned about the cost of
using a full regular expression match. Because of this,
the Slate interprets any tag starting with an underscore
as a complex item id, which is why it complains when it
turns out that <b>$id.myitem</b> is not in fact
a complex item.

<p><b>Work-around</b>: Use <b>myitem.$id</b> instead.

<p><b>Cure</b>: We should replace string matches
with proper regexps once we have the byte-compiler:
<pre>
    if [regexp {[0-9]+} $tag] {
        # $tag is a simple item
        ...
    } elseif [regexp {_[0-9]+} $tag] {
        # $tag is a complex item
        ...
    } else {
        # $tag is a tag
        ...
    }
</pre>


<p><li><b>Question</b>:
The Slate is supposed to be upwards-compatible with the Tk canvas.
Well, when I converted my code using the Tk canvas to 
use the Tycho Slate, it just didn't work. Why?

<p><b>Answer</b>:
Unfortunately, full upwards compatibility got lost 
because a) we insisted on implementing the Slate
entirely in Itcl to maintain portability and b) we
had to make a few compromises made along the way.
Here are the most likely causes of incompatibility:

<ul>

<li>Tags cannot begin with an underscore. (The Slate usurps
these as complex item IDs.)
<li>Tags cannot begin with a hash (#). (The Slate usurps
these for "invisible" item.)
<li>We (i.e. Reekie, it's still his fault) messed up.
<a href="" "mailto:johnr@eecs.berkeley.edu">Send us</a>
some mail about it. (Some sample code and/or a stack trace
would help a lot!)

</ul>

<p><li><b>Question</b>:
The Slate is supposed to be upwards-compatible with the Tk canvas.
OK, so I converted my code to use the Tycho Slate and it's
ridiculously slow. Why?

<p><b>Answer</b>:
In real applications, the Slate is "not all that much
slower" than the Tk canvas. If you've noticed a noticeable
slow-down, it could be because you're using tags to
access items instead of item ID's.

<p>Let me explain: The Tk canvas allow items to be accessed
by tag or by item ID. For example, you might have some
code triggered by a mouse event like this:
<pre>
    $canvas dothis current args
    $canvas dothat current args
</pre>

("current" denotes the item being moused on.) With the Slate,
this will still work (in theory), because each Slate
method tries to figure out whether it's being passed an
item ID or a tag and act in the same or similar manner to
the Tk canvas. Unfortunately, if you <i>do</i> pass the Slate
a tag instead of an item ID, it has to do a certain amount
of work to figure out what item or items are actually represented
by that tag. Since the code is written in Tcl ("Takes Considerably
Longer"), that means noticeable delays.

<p><b>Work-around</b>:
Instead of accessing items by tag, access them by item ID. For example,
replace the above code by:
<pre>
    set id [$slate find withtag current]
    $slate dothis $id args
    $slate dothat $id args
</pre>

<p><b>Cure</b>:
The cure is to integrate Tk into Java and use that... Good luck!


<p><li><b>Question</b>:
I wrote some testing code that assigns the "current" tag to
an item with something like <b>$slate addtag current withtag 
$item</b>, and I'm getting some bizarre errors. Any clues?

<p><b>Answer</b>: The Slate doesn't prevent you from assigning
the "current" tag to a complex item. Unfortunately, it doesn't
cope when you attempt to "find" the current item, since it assumes 
that there is only
a single canvas item with the "current" tag. As a result, you
will be getting a list of the canvas items when you try to
"find" the current item, rather than a single complex item id.

<p><b>Work-around</b>: Instead of assigning to the tag to a
complex item, assign it to a simple component. Here's the most
likely code to work:
<pre>
    $slate addtag current withtag [$slate primary $id]
</pre>

<p><b>Cure</b>: The <b>find withtag</b> operation should
deal with the case where multiple canvas items have the 
<b>current</b> tag.


<p><li><b>Question</b>:
I can see that many classes in the <b>tycho/slate</b>
directory contain common arrays indexed by the id of an item.
Some, though, use just the item ID, while others do a weird
thing with an id obtained from a slate, like this:
<pre>
    set unique $id.[$slate uniqueid]
    set option(foo.$unique) ...
</pre>
Why?

<p><b>Answer</b>:
Well, you realize that the common arrays are indexed by
item ID because actually creating Itcl objects for each
complex item turned out to be too expensive. In effect,
we are trying to implement OO in a non-OO way. Now, since the
arrays are common, we have to guarantee that the indexes are
unique. There are two situations, which arise because of the
ways that various classes in these directories are implemented.
(Note, by the way, that the IDs of complex items are generated from
a common variable in IncrCanvas.) The two situations are:

<ol>
<li>ComplexItem and subclasses. These classes only ever manipulate
item IDs of complex items, which are guaranteed to be unique
across all Slates. They therefore use indexes into common arrays such
as <b>foo.$id</b>
 
<li>The Shape classes. These classes manipulate simple and complex items.
Since simple item IDs are unique only within each Slate (since they
are generated by a Tk canvas), array indexes also need to contain the
Slate name to guarantee uniqueness. To avoid the use of the full Slate
name, each Slate also has a unique ID -- hence the code reproduced above.

</ol>

<p><b>Work-around</b>:
No work-around is required.

<p><b>Cure</b>: There is no cure! (At least, not one that
would making writing ComplexItem subclasses harder to write.)


<p><li><b>Question</b>:
The ComplexItem class and its subclasses would be more
easily implemented as Itcl classes. You're using
an OO language pretty much in the same as I used to use
C to fake OO. Why aren't ComplexItems objects?

<p><b>Answer</b>:
We did that... and it was too slow. Not horrendously slow...
not breathtakingly slow (well, not any more than Tcl was to
start with...)... but slow enough to worry us.
So we "flattened" the OO structure into an essentially-procedural  
implementation and it turned out to be about three times faster.
So that was that....

<p>As it turned out, the procedural version was simpler
to develop anyway. Much as I'd like to do a full OO
implementation, Itcl is not really designed for that
granularity, and the procedural version of the ComplexItem
classes just "works better."
