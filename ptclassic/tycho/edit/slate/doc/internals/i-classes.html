<h2><a name="Interactors: Mouse tracking interactors"></a>Mouse tracking interactors</h2>

<p>The most numerous and best-developed set of interactors in Tycho are
those that "track" movement of the mouse in some way. These interactors 
can all be cascaded -- for example, cascading a <i>Bounder</i> with a 
<i>Stepper</i> will move an item in discrete steps <i>and</i> keep it within 
a given region of the Slate.

<h3><a name="Interactors: Follower interactor"></a><a href="../codeDoc/Follower.html">Follower</a></h3>

<i>Follower</i> just follows the mouse exactly. It is the most basic 
kind of mouse tracker, and is the superclass of all other mouse 
trackers. It has no options other than those in the <i>Interactor</i> 
superclass.

<h3><a name="Interactors: Bounder interactor"><a href="../codeDoc/Bounder.html">Bounder</a></h3>

<i>Bounder</i> moves an item, but keeps it within a rectangular region
of the Slate. It can also constrain the movement of the item in other
ways.  It adds the following options:

<ul>

<li><b>-bounds</b>.  A four-list giving the rectangular coordinates in 
which to keep the target item.  If it is the empty list, then the 
Bounder keeps the target item within the coordinates of the slate.

<li><b>-constrain</b>. This option further restricts
movement along certain axes. The default is "none." It can
have the following values:
<ul>
<li><b>none</b>: Move anywhere within the bounds
<li><b>x</b>: Move only along the horizontal axis
<li><b>y</b>: Move only along the horizontal axis
<li><b>positive</b>: Move only along the positive diagonal axis
<li><b>negative</b>: Move only along the negative diagonal axis
</ul>

</ul>

<h3><a name="Interactors: Stepper interactor"><a href="../codeDoc/Stepper.html"> Stepper</a></h3>

<i>Stepper</i> quantizes the mouse movement. It 
adds the following options:

<ul>

<li><b>-stepsize</b>. The quantization step size. The default is 12.

<li><b>-gridded</b>. If true, the cursor movement is quantized to a
grid with size given by the <b>-stepsize</b> option. Otherwise,
the change in coordinates is quantized (the default).

</ul>


<h2><a name="Interactors: Repeater interactor"><a href="../codeDoc/Repeater.html">Repeater</a></h2>

<p> The Repeater interactor is used to provide recurring stimulus
while the mouse is held down. Once activated on an item, it executes a
command it fixed time intervals for as long as the mouse is held down.
It is used, for example, in the <a
href="../usersGuides/SliderHelp.html">Slider</a> widget to move the
slider bar while the mouse is pressed anywhere above or below the bar.

 <P>Repeater adds the following options:

<ul>

<li><b>-command</b>. The script that is executed repeatedly as
long as the mouse button is held down.

<li><b>-delay</b>. The time delay between the first and second clicks.

<li><b>-interval</b>. The time interval between executions of the script.

</ul>


<h2><a name="Interactors: TextItemEdit interactor"><a href="../codeDoc/TextItemEdit.html">TextItemEdit</a></h2>

<p> The Tk canvas (and thus the Slate) provides no built-in editing
capabilities for text. The <i>TextItemEdit</i> interactor encapsulates the 
code needed by the Slate to support basic interactive editing on text 
items. Note that this is intended only for editing small
items like labels in diagrams.

<p> The interactor is attached to one or a set of Slate items with the 
<b>bind</b> command (as usual).  Once activated, the insertion 
cursor remains in the text item until the <b>stop</b> method is 
called.  How this method is called depends on the client -- it will 
usually be by the user clicking on a different object.  (The 
usual click-drag-release sequence <i>is</i> used in this interactor, but 
to drag-select text.)

<p> While an item has the insertion cursor, the text can be edited as 
follows:

<ul>
<li>Typing deletes the selection (if any) and inserts text;
<li>Left and right cursor keys move one character, control-left and
control-right move a word;
<li>Text can be drag-selected with the mouse; double-click and dragging
selects words at a time;
<li>Holding shift while pressing cursor keys extends the selection.
</ul>

<h2><a name="Interactors: Selector interactor"><a href="../codeDoc/Selector.html">Selector</a></h2>

<p> The <i>Selector</i> interactor provides the Slate with a general
selection mechanism. In effect, it coordinates a number of interactors
in order to achieve complex user interaction. By default, the Slate
contains a single Selector object that can be accessed through the
<b>selector</b>, <b>select</b>, and <b>deselect</b>
method. In more complex editors, multiple selectors can be created
(such as for selecting within different hierarchical items).

 <P>More detail on the selection mechanism is given in
