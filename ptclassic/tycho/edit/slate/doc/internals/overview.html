<h1>Class overview</h1>


 <P>The Slate is structured as a set of classes in the <B>::tycho</B>
namespace. It runs with either vanilla Tcl (8.0) or [incr Tcl] (3.0).
The Slate was originally written for [incr Tcl], so all of the code is
written in an object-oriented style. To run in vanilla Tcl, the Slate
uses a small object-oriented layer that simulates objects (see the
installation notes).

 <P> The two main classes in this package are IncrCanvas and Slate.
IncrCanvas is the basic widget that extends the Tk canvas to work with
complex items. The Slate is a subclass of IncrCanvas that adds the
more advanced features.  Generally, you will just create an instance
of Slate.

 <P>There are three main tress in the rest of the support classes.
The tree rooted by ComplexItem contains all of the 
complex item classes (a.k.a the user-defined items). The Shape
tree contains the objects that handle information related to
the shape of items. Finally, the Interactor tree contains the
interactor classes.
