<h1>Checklist</h1>


 <P><B>Warning</B>: this page is out of date. <!-- FIXME -->

<p>This page list the steps needed to create a ComplexItem subclass.
(Of course, the best way is to make a copy of an existing class that
is close to what you need, but this page should help you make sure
that you don't miss anything.)

<dl>
<p><dt><b>Inheritance</b>

<dd>The class must inherit from 
<b>::tycho::ComplexItem</b> or one of its subclasses.

<p><dt><b>Methods</b>

<dd> Every "method" is implemented as a public procedure. The first 
three arguments must always be the item ID, the canvas name, 
and the slate name.

<p><dt><b>Constructor and destructor</b>

<dd> The class must contain a procedure
called <b>construct</b> with the above three arguments, followed 
by a list of tags to be attached to components, followed by two or more
coordinates, followed by option-value pairs. Unless the class has 
no options, it must start with this code:
<pre>foreach {opt value} [concat [array get optiondefault] $args] {
    set option([string trimleft $opt -]$id) $value
}
</pre>

The construction procedure does <i>not</i> automatically call its 
superclass "constructors": if your class needs that, you have to do it
yourself.
The destructor is optional, and is needed only if the class needs to
do something other than destroy its components.

<p><dt><b>Virtual method table</b>

<dd> Complex item classes simulate inheritance explicitly using an
array as a "virtual method table." Every class must contain
the declaration
<pre>common methodtable
</pre>

(Do not change the name!) The class must (in the class body) 
initialize the table with the contents of the table in its superclass; 
assuming that the superclass is <b>ComplexItem</b>, the class body 
then contains:
<pre>array set methodtable [array get ::tycho::ComplexItem::methodtable]
</pre>

The class must then "override" superclass "methods" with its
own. The <b>construct</b> method is compulsory; others are 
optional. Suppose your class overrides <b>coords</b> (which many 
classes do), your class body contains:

<pre>set methodtable(construct)   ::tycho::Bar::construct
set methodtable(coords)      ::tycho::Bar::coords
</pre>

where "Bar" is the name of your class. If your class adds options,
you must also add the option update procedures (see below).

<p><dt><b>Instance variables</b>

<dd> "Instance variables" are stored in the common array
<b>variable</b>, declared in the ComplexItem class.
Index the elements of this array by variable and followed by
item id. For example, to set a variable foo, use
<pre>set variable(foo$id) "bar"
</pre>


<p><dt><b>Option declarations</b>

<dd>For each option, say <b>-foo</b>, the class must contain
a public procedure named <b>_foo</b>. Option variable values
are stored in the common array <b>option</b>, declared in
the ComplexItem superclass. Each element of the array is
indexed by the option name (without leading dash) followed
by the item id. For example, to read the option  foo, use
<pre>$option(foo$id)
</pre>

<p>The procedure <b>_foo</b> is called by the IncrCanvas when an
option is changed (with its <b>itemconfigure</b> method). The
procedure must take, in addition to the usual three arguments, one
argument that it assigns to <b>option(foo$id)</b>; it can then
perform any actions that would normally (in a regular [incr Tcl]
object) be done by the configuration body of a public variable or
<b>itk_option</b>.

<p><dt><b>Option defaults</b>

<dd>The class body must contain the declaration:
<pre>common optiondefault
</pre>

The class body must contain the declaration:
<pre>array set optiondefault [array get ::tycho::ComplexItem::optiondefault]
</pre>

<p>
Each option defined in  this class must have its default value
added to this array:
<pre>set optiondefault(-foo) bool
</pre>

<p><dt><b>Option update</b>

<dd><p>Each option must have its update procedure added to the "virtual
method table":
<pre>set methodtable(_foo) ::tycho::Bar::_foo
</pre>

<p><dt><b>Item shape</b>

<dd>The class body may need to set a different value of the
<b>-shape</b> option:
<pre>set optiondefault(-shape) rectangle
</pre>

where instead of <b>rectangle</b> you could have
<b>oval</b>, <b>point</b>, <b>line</b>, or
<b>polygon</b>.

</dl>

Um, OK, other than that, you can do <i>whatever</i> you want...
The best way to do this, really, is just to go and use the
existing classes as examples. It's simpler than it sounds.
