<h1>Constraints</h1>

<p>The Slate supports a simple constraint mechanism. The mechanism
is really just a simple notification mechanism, and allows scripts
to be executed when certain kinds of operations are performed on
items.

<p>First, we'll create a Slate with some items on it:

<tcl quiet><pre>
  source $tycho/editors/slate/doc/internals/newslate.itcl
  set a [$slate create Frame 30 30 70 50 -color green -tags moveable]
  set b [$slate create Frame 100 100 130 130 &#92
		-color peachpuff -tags moveable]
</pre></tcl>

Now draw a line between them:
<tcl quiet><pre>
  set l [eval $slate create line &#92
		[$slate aspect $a se] &#92
		[$slate aspect $b nw] &#92
		-tags moveable -arrow last]
</pre></tcl>

We want the line to remain connected to the boxes if we move either
of the boxes. To do so, attach a constraint to each box, as follows:
<tcl quiet><pre>
  $slate constraint $a "move" {lambda id x y -&gt; &#92
		$slate reshape $l $x $y "start"}
  $slate constraint $b "move" {lambda id x y -&gt; &#92
		$slate reshape $l $x $y "end"}
</pre></tcl>

(Try moving the boxes.)
The first command here says that, when box <i>a</i> is moved, to move
the <i>start</i> of the line by the same amount; the second line says
that when box <i>b</i> is moved, to move the <i>end</i> of the line by
the same amount.

<p>Now, suppose we also want the boxes to move if we move the line. This
is simple enough -- attach a constraint to the line, so that
when it is moved, both boxes are moved:

<tcl quiet><pre>
  $slate constraint $l "move" {lambda id x y -> 
	$slate move $a $x $y; &#92
	$slate move $b $x $y }
</pre></tcl>

(Try moving the line. You have to position the mouse
fairly carefully to "grab" it.)
You will notice the constraints here are circular: moving the line
moves the boxes, which in turn will try to reshape the line.
The Slate checks for this kind of circularity and simply
stops propagating constraints if a constraint attempts to
move or reshape an item that has already been moved or reshaped.
