<h1>User's Guide to the Slider widget</h1>

<P>
The Slider widget displays a movable "bar" that slides along
a vertical "trough." It performs the same function  as the Tk
<i>scale</i> widget but looks more like a physical slider, so works 
better in "control panels" and similar styles of interface.

<P>At the top of the slider is a display of the current 
value. Below that is the trough and slider bar, and at the bottom a 
label. To move the slider and change its value, simply click on the 
bar with the left button and drag it. If the resolution of the slider has 
been set to a non-zero value, the slider jumps in appropriate 
increments; if not, it moves smoothly.

<p>There are two other ways of moving the slider: clicking with the left 
button anywhere near the slider will cause the slider to repeatedly move 
one step (one resolution increment if non-zero, else one pixel) at a 
time.  There is a delay between the first and second steps of about 400 
ms; after, steps repeat at about 10 times per second. The bar steps 
moving when it reaches the mouse cursor.

<p>Clicking with the middle button anywhere near the trough makes the 
bar "jump" to the mouse position. If the button remains held down 
while the mouse is moved, the bar follows the mouse.
