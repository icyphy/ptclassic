 <P> The Tycho text editor package, <CODE>tycho.edit.textedit</CODE>,
provides a variety of specialized text editors and command-line
shells.  All of these are derived from the Edit class, and therefore
inherit all of its features. They add a wealth of featues such as
syntax-sensitive indentation and coloring, automatic documentation
generation, and source code compilation.
