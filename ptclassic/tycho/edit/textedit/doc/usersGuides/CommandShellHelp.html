<h1>User's Guide to the Command Shell</h1>
<B>The CommandShell is not included with Tycho0.1.1.</B>
<p>
The CommandShell class in Tycho provides a shell for interacting with
the user's command shell, such as sh or csh. 
The Command class is derived from the
<a href="../../../../kernel/doc/usersGuides/TclShellHelp.html">TclShell class</a>,
and therefore inherits all of its features.
In particular, the mechanisms for scrolling through and editing
command histories are fully supported.

<LI> Interrupting a long running command with Control-C may not work.
In any case, typing Control-C ends the current shell, not the program
running inside the shell.
