<p>
This class provides a text editor specialized for editing
HTML source.
The <a name="EditHTML class">EditHTML class</a> is derived from the
<a href="../../../../kernel/doc/usersGuides/EditHelp.html">Edit class</a>, and
therefore inherits all of its features.
It colors HTML commands and supports
<a name="hypertext links">hypertext links</a>.
That is, hypertext references in the HTML file are live.
Note that after entering hypertext links,
you will need to invoke the <a name=recolorize>"Recolorize"</a>
command in the "Format"
menu for the hypertext links to become live.
<p>
A special feature is the <a name="check links command">"check links"</a>
command, available under the "Edit" menu.
This command identifies all the hypertext links in the file
and checks to see whether they are valid.
It is currently limited to links of the forms:
<pre>
    &lt;a href="filename"&gt;
    &lt;a href="#point"&gt;
    &lt;a href="filename#point"&gt;
</pre>
The "point" is a name within the file identified by a
<a name="name attribute">name attribute</a>.
The quotation marks are optional, unless there are spaces in either
the filename or the point.
An invalid link is one where the referenced file does not exist
or is not readable, or the named point within the file does not exist.
When an invalid link is found, the user is queried for a substitute.
<p>
The
<a href="../../../../kernel/doc/usersGuides/HTMLHelp.html">
Tycho HTML browser</a>
support some Tycho-specific
<a href="../../../../doc/documentation.html#HTML extensions">
HTML extensions</a>.
Moreover, there is an automatic 
<a href="../../../../doc/documentation.html#indexing documents">
index generator</a>.
