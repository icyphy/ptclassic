<h1><a name="Tcl editor">User's Guide to the Itcl Editor</a></h1>
<p>
This class provides a text editor specialized for editing
Itcl source.
It is automatically invoked whenever you open any file with an
<a name=".itcl">".itcl" extension</a> or
<a name=".itk">".itk" extension</a>.
Itcl is an object-oriented extension to the Tcl language
that was developed by Michael McLennan of AT&T Bell Labs.
(Itk is the associated extension to Tk).
The <a name="EditItcl class">EditItcl class</a> is derived from the
<a href=EditTclHelp.html>EditTcl class</a>, and
therefore inherits all of its features.
It colors certain Itcl constructs, such as comments
and class and method definitions.
<p>
This class inherits its hyperlink mechanism (the
<a name="Show Links command">"Show Links" command</a> in the "Format" menu)
from the Tcl editor.
However, because of the namespaces in itcl, the references to
procedures and methods are only identified if
they are completely qualified.  For
example, "::tycho::EditTcl" will be identified as a link,
but "EditTclText" will not.  Unfortunately, since itcl-2.0 is
dynamically scoped, it appears that there is no way around this.
<p>
For the
<a name="Evaluate command">"Evaluate" command</a> in the "File" menu
to work, the editor keeps track of
classes that are defined within so that it can delete the class
definitions and instances before evaluating the file. Note that for
this to work, all derived classes must be accessible by auto-loading.
This implies some formatting restrictions on the source code file.
Specifically, class definitions must appear with the keyword "class"
starting in column zero and the class name following it on the same
line.
