<p>
This class provides a text editor specialized for editing
makefiles.
It is invoked automatically when opening any file with the
name <CODE>makefile</CODE>, <CODE>Makefile</CODE>, or any file with the
<a name=".mk extension"><CODE>.mk</CODE> extension</a> or
<a name=".vc extension"><CODE>.vc</CODE> extension</a> in its name.
The <a name="EditMake class">EditMake class</a> is derived from the
<a href="EditProgramHelp.html">EditProgram class</a>, and
therefore inherits all of its features.
It provides additional features
for editing <CODE>Makefile</CODE> source code.
It colors variables, referenced variables, includes, and rules.
It disables the indenting features of the base class, so
tabs are inserted by using the <CODE>Tab</CODE> key, as normal.
<p>
In the <CODE>Special</CODE> menu, the <CODE>Generate VC Makefile</CODE> 
menu choice will create a
<A NAME="Microsoft visual c++">Microsoft Visual C++</A> format
<A NAME="nmake"><CODE>nmake</CODE></A> file.
Note that the conversion process is not perfect,
but some of the common tasks, such as conversion to
DOS style pathnames, are handled.
