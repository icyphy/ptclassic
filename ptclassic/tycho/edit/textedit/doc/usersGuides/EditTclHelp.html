<p>
This class provides a text editor specialized for editing
Tcl source.
It is automatically invoked whenever you open a file with an
<a name=".tcl extension"><CODE>.tcl</CODE> extension</a>.
Tcl is a scripting language developed by John Ousterhout at
U.C. Berkeley (now at Sun Microsystems).
The <a name="EditTcl class">EditTcl class</a> is derived from the
<a href="EditProgramHelp.html">EditProgram class</a>, and
therefore inherits all of its features.
It colors certain Tcl constructs, such as comments
and procedure definitions.
<p>
One feature provided by this class is that the
<a name="Evaluate command"><CODE>Evaluate</CODE> command</a> in the
<CODE>File</CODE> menu
evaluated the Tcl code in the current (Tycho) Tcl editor.
If there is a selection, then the code in the selection is evaluated.
 Otherwise, the entire file is evaluated.

 <P>The <A NAME="Evaluate proc command"><CODE>Evaluate Proc</CODE>
command </A> in the <CODE>File</CODE> menu will evaluate the Tcl
<CODE>proc</CODE> that the insertion cursor is inside of.  The
returned value is displayed.
