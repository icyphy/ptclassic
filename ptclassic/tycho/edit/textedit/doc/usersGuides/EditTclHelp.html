<p>
This class provides a text editor specialized for editing
Tcl source.
It is automatically invoked whenever you open a file with an
<a name=".tcl extension">".tcl" extension</a>.
Tcl is a scripting language developed by John Ousterhout at
U.C. Berkeley (now at Sun Microsystems).
The <a name="EditTcl class">EditTcl class</a> is derived from the
<a href="EditProgramHelp.html">EditProgram class</a>, and
therefore inherits all of its features.
It colors certain Tcl constructs, such as comments
and procedure definitions.
<p>
A unique feature of this editor is its ability to create hyperlinks
to procedure definitions.
This feature is invoked by the
<a name="Show Links command">"Show Links" command</a> in the "Format"
menu.
Upon invoking this command,
any procedure that is registered
in the current (Tycho) Tcl process for auto-loading will be colored
and underlined, and will become a hyperlink to its definition in
the source code.
Internally, the Tcl process uses a
global array <a name="auto_index"><CODE>auto_index</CODE></a> for registering
procedures that can be auto loaded.
<p>
Another feature provided by this class is that the
<a name="Evaluate command">"Evaluate" command</a> in the "File" menu
evaluated the Tcl code in the current (Tycho) Tcl editor.
If there is a selection, then the code in the selection is evaluated.
 Otherwise, the entire file is evaluated.
 <P>The <A NAME="Evaluate proc command">"Evaluate Proc" command </A> in
the "File" menu will evaluate the Tcl <CODE>proc</CODE> that the 
insertion cursor is inside of.
The returned value is displayed.
