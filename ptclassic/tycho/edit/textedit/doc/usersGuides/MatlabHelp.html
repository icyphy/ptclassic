<h1>User's Guide to the Tycho Matlab Console Window</h1>
<p>
The Matlab class in Tycho provides a shell for interacting with
Matlab.  Currently, this only works if Tycho is running with Ptolemy
(see <a href=running.html>Running Tycho</a>), and Ptolemy has been
compiled to work with Matlab.
The Matlab class is derived from the
<a href=ConsoleHelp.html>Console class</a>, and
therefore inherits all of its features.
In particular, the mechanisms for scrolling through and editing
command histories are fully supported.
In addition, Matlab data can be accessed from Tcl or Ptolemy
using ptcl commands.  See the ptcl documentation.
