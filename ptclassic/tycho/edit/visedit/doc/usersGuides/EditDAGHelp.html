<h1><a name="directed acyclic graph (DAG) editor">User's Guide to the Directed Acyclic Graph Editor</a></h1>
This class provides a graphical editor specialized for editing
a directed acyclic graph (DAG).
It is automatically invoked whenever you open any file with a
<A NAME=".dag"><CODE>.dag</CODE> extension</A>.
A DAG is a Graph that does not have cycles.  Support for DAGs is built
into the kernel in the 
<A HREF="../codeDoc/DirectedAcyclicGraph.html"><CODE>DirectedAcyclicGraph</CODE></A>
class.
<A NAME="EditDAG class">EditDAG class</A> is derived from the 
<A HREF="GraphicsHelp.html">Graphics class</A>, and therefore
inherits all of its features.
 <p>
Editing DAG nodes is not supported.
 <p>
The <CODE>viseditViewOnly</CODE> preference controls whether the
<CODE>Edit</CODE> menu appears.  This preference is a member 
of the <CODE>interaction</CODE> style sheet.
By default <CODE>viseditViewOnly</CODE> is true, which means that
the EditDAG class is only a viewer, nodes cannot be edited.
<P>
Nodes in the canvas widget can be mouse sensitive.  For an example of 
DAG, see
<A HREF="../../../../doc/tychoClasses.dag"><CODE>$TYCHO/doc/tychoClasses.dag</CODE></A>

<p> For DAG file format information, see the <a href="../codeDoc/EditDAG.html"><code>EditDAG</code> code documentation</a>.
