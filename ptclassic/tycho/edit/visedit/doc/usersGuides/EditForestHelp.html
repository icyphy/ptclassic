<h1><a name="forest editor">User's Guide to the Forest Editor</a></h1>
<p>
This class provides a visual editor specialized for viewing
forests.
A forest is a data structure that includes any number of trees. A
<a name="tree">tree</a>
is a data structure with nodes that are either a root or have
exactly one parent, and that have any number of children.
It is invoked automatically when opening any file with the
<a name=".fst extension"><CODE>.fst</CODE> extension</a> 
in its name.
The forest editor is derived from the
<a href="GraphicsHelp.html">Graphics class</a>, and
therefore inherits all of its features.
 <p>
The <CODE>viseditViewOnly</CODE> preference controls whether the
<CODE>Edit</CODE> menu appears.  This preference is a member 
of the <CODE>interaction</CODE> style sheet.
By default <CODE>viseditViewOnly</CODE> is true, which means that
the EditForest class is only a viewer, nodes cannot be edited.
 <p>
The text below describes the EditForest editing commands, but not that
the editing commands do not work very well, and should eventually
be replaced.

<p>
Menu commands for adding new nodes, deleting nodes, and editing
the name or contents of the nodes are provided.
Here is an example of how to use the EditForest:
<tcl><pre>
    ::tycho::view EditForest -file &#92
         $TYCHO/editors/visedit/test/sample.fst
</pre></tcl>
<p>
Clicking the left mouse button on any node selects it.
Clicking away from any node deselects selected nodes.
The selected node may be deleted using the <CODE>Cut</CODE> command, which
also saves the node to the clipboard.
A node in the clipboard may be pasted using the <CODE>Paste</CODE> command.
If a node is selected when the <CODE>Paste</CODE> command is issued, then
the node in the clipboard is pasted as a child of the selected node.
Otherwise, it is pasted as a root node.
The <CODE>Copy</CODE> command saves a node to the clipboard without
deleting it.  However, this node can only be pasted in
another window, because every node is required to have
a unique name.
<p>
A selected node may be edited using the <CODE>Edit Node</CODE> menu choice
A new root may be added using the <CODE>New Root</CODE> menu choice.
A new child node may be added to a selected node using
the <CODE>New Child</CODE> menu choice.
<p>
The contents of a node is an arbitrary Tcl string.
However, if the data takes a certain form, then the display and behavior
of the editor can be controlled very precisely.  In particular, the
contents of the node can be a list, with items in the list being lists
lists of the form <CODE>{<i>keyword value</i>}</CODE>.  The following keywords
are currently understood:
<dl>

<dt><code>label</code><dd>The <code><i>value</i></code> field gives
the label used to show the node in the display.  If this is not
present, then the node name is used.

<dt><code>color</code><dd>The <code><i>value</i></code> field gives
the color used to show the node in the display.  If this is not
present, then the node color is black.  The color name is processed to
make sure it is valid, and if not, black is used.

<dt><code>font</code><dd>The <code><i>value</i></code> field gives the
font used to show the node in the display.  If this is not present,
then the default variable-spacing font is chosen.  The
<code><i>value</i></code> can take any form understood by the
<code>getFont</code> method of the <code>FontManager</code> class.

<dt><code>link</code><dd>The <code><i>value</i></code> field gives a
list with two elements, a filename and a point within the file, in the
standard Tycho hyperlink format.  Double clicking on the node will
activate the hyperlink.  The filename may be absolute or relative, and
may begin with an environment variable (such as <CODE>$TYCHO</CODE>),
or a user directory (<CODE>~<i>username</i></CODE>).  If the filename
is relative, then the reference directory is that of the file of the
top-level editor that contains this <code>EditForest</code>.  The
point may be a string identifying a named anchor in an HTML file, or
<CODE>{line <i>linenumber</i>}</CODE> or <CODE>{range <i>start
end</i>}</CODE> for text files, or any other destination that is
understood by the <code>seePoint</code> method of the widget that will
display the hyperlink.

<dt><code>html</code><dd>The <code><i>value</i></code> field gives
HTML source code that will be rendered and displayed in a message
window in response to a double click on the node.  If both this field
and the <CODE>link</CODE> field are given, then both will be activated
by a double click.
