ptplot3.1p1 - A Java plotting package
implemented in Java.
Ptplot is embeddable in applets and applications.
For more information, see ptolemy/plot/doc/index.htm

Installer notes 
If you are using the auto installer, then note that
under Windows, the Ptplot programs will be added to
your start menu under Ptolemy -> Ptplot.  Note further
that directory names with spaces do not work very well
 because of limitations in the InstallShield tool.
