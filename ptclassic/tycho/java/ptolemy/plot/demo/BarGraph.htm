Here is an example of a bar graph:
<p>
<applet name="BarGraph"
    code="ptolemy.plot.PlotApplet"
    width=600
    height=400
    codebase="../../.."
    archive="ptolemy/plot/plotapplet.jar"
    alt="If you had a java-enabled browser, you would see an applet here."
>
<param name="dataurl" value="bargraph.plt">
<param name="background" value="faf0e6">
    <hr>If your browser recognized the applet tag,
    you would see an applet here.<hr>
</applet>
<p> Here, data is read from an <a href="bargraph.plt">ASCII file</a> at a URL. 
  The format of that file is the &quot;old ptplot format,&quot; which is simpler 
  than PlotML, but not as compatible with modern web tools. The horizontal axis 
  is manually labeled with tick marks indicating years. It is possible to control 
  the thickness of bars and the offset of the bars behind by editing that file. 
  For details about the file format, see the documentation for the <a href="../../../doc/codeDoc/ptolemy/plot/Plot.html" target="_top">Plot</a> 
  and <a href="../../../doc/codeDoc/ptolemy/plot/PlotBox.html" target="_top">PlotBox</a> 
  classes.
