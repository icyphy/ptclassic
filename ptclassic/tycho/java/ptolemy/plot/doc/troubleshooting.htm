Below is a list of common Ptplot problems.


<H2><A NAME="Problems Starting Ptplot">Problems starting ptplot or
running applets</A></H2>

<H3><A NAME="CLASSPATH">Security violation</A></H3>
 <P>
One known problem is that if you have a
CLASSPATH environment set when you started your browser, you may get
an error message when accessing some of the demos.
We suggest unsetting this environment variable, restarting your
browser (and sending email to Sun's Java team to complain about the
way the CLASSPATH environment variable works).
You may also want to check the
<a href="http://metalab.unc.edu/javafaq/javafaq.html">Java FAQ</a>.
<p>
If you have CLASSPATH set, and you run Netscape, then you might see
messages like:
<PRE>
Applet Marks can't start: security violation: security.class
from local disk trying to access url:
http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/java/ptolemy/plot/demo/data.plt
</PRE>
The
CLASSPATH variable is by far and above the trickiest thing to get right.

<H3>Script fails with: Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: ptolemy/plot/plotml/EditablePlotMLApplication</H3>
Here is an example
<PRE>
bash-2.02$ ./ptplot
./ptplot: Could not find '/tmp/ptolemy/plot'.  Perhaps your PTII
 variable is not set properly?
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: ptolemy/plot/plotml/EditablePlotMLApplication
</PRE>

The problem here is that the pxgraph script cannot find the ptplot
installation.  This probably means that your PTII environment variable
is not set correctly.  Set it to point to the home directory
of the plot or Ptolemy II distribution.
 <P>
To debug such a situation completely,
use <CODE>which</CODE> (on Unix) or <code>type</code> (on Windows with Cygwin)
to find out which ptplot
script is running, and the run it with the <CODE>sh -x</CODE> flag:
First we run <CODE>which</CODE>:
<PRE>
bash-2.02$ type ptplot
ptplot is /users/cxh/ptII/bin/ptplot
</PRE>
The we use <CODE>sh -x</CODE>.  Note that the output you see might be
different, depending on what version of the <CODE>pxgraph</CODE> script
you are running.
<PRE>
bash-2.02$ sh -x /users/cxh/ptII/bin/ptplot
+ PTII_DEFAULT=/users/cxh/ptII_old
+ PTJAVA_DIR=/jdk1.2.2
+ '[' -z '' ']'
+ '[' -d /users/cxh/ptII_old ']'
+ PTII=/users/cxh/ptII_old
+ export PTII
+ '[' '!' -d /users/cxh/ptII_old/ptolemy/plot ']'
+ echo '/users/cxh/ptII/bin/ptplot: Could not find '\''/users/cxh/ptII_old/ptole
my/plot'\''.  Perhaps your PTII'
/users/cxh/ptII/bin/ptplot: Could not find '/users/cxh/ptII_old/ptolemy/plot'.
Perhaps your PTII
+ echo ' variable is not set properly?'
 variable is not set properly?
++ basename /users/cxh/ptII/bin/ptplot
+ '[' ptplot = pxgraph ']'
++ basename /users/cxh/ptII/bin/ptplot
+ '[' ptplot = histogram ']'
+ javastartupclass=ptolemy.plot.plotml.EditablePlotMLApplication
+ windows=no
+ windows=yes
+ '[' -z '' ']'
+ '[' -d /jdk1.2.2 ']'
+ JAVAHOME=/jdk1.2.2
+ export JAVAHOME
+ '[' -z /jdk1.2.2 ']'
+ '[' -z /jdk1.2.2 ']'
+ '[' yes = yes ']'
++ cd /users/cxh/ptII_old
++ cmd /c chdir
++ tr -d '\r'
+ WINPTII=D:\users\cxh\ptII_old
+ /jdk1.2.2/bin/java -classpath 'D:\users\cxh\ptII_old;/jdk1.2.2\lib\classes.zip' ptolemy.plot.plotml.EditablePlotMLApplication
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: ptolemy/plot/plotml/E
ditablePlotMLApplication
bash-2.02$
</PRE>

In the output below, the key line is the line towards that bottom that
runs the <CODE>java</CODE> interpreter:
<PRE>
+ /jdk1.2.2/bin/java -classpath 'D:\users\cxh\ptII_old;/jdk1.2.2\lib\classes.zip' ptolemy.plot.plotml.EditablePlotMLApplication
</PRE>
In the ptplot script, the first element in the <CODE>-classpath</CODE>
argument should be a pathname that leads to the top of the Ptolemy II
or Ptplot directory tree.

<p>In this case, there are two problems, one is that <code>$PTII</code>
is not set, so the script is using the value of <code>PTII_DEFAULT</code>
which was hardwired into the script when <code>configure</code> was run. 
Unfortunately, the <code>ptplot</code> script
was left over from an old installation, and at the top
of the script PTII_DEFAULT was set to <CODE>/users/cxh/ptII_old</CODE>
is an empty directory that does not contain a Ptolemy II tree.

<p> The fix is to rerun <code>configure</code>  and
<code>make install</code> so that the <code>ptplot</code> script
is properly set up.

 <P>Another common fix is to edit the <CODE>pxgraph</CODE> script
and change the variables at the top to point to the proper location.
