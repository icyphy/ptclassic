The Tycho Tcl Loader will dynamically load in a shared object at run
time, which will introduce a new tcl command into a running
interpreter.  See the Tcl <CODE>package</CODE> documentation for more
information.

 <P>The Loader attempts to load a Tcl Package, and if the Package
can't be found, it looks in the Ptolemy Tree for the appropriate file.
If the shared object cannot be found in the Ptolemy Tree, then the
user is prompted for a binary to load.
