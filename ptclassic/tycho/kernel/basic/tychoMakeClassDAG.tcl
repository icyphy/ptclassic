#### tychoMkClassGraph
# Make a class graph of the type displayed by the Tycho EditDAG class.
# The first argument is the name of the graph. The second argument is
# the name of the graph file to create. The rest of the arguments are
# any number of file names from which the graph should be created.
# These file names should be absolute (or relative to an environment
# variable like TYCHO) that the resulting hyperlinks work from any
# directory. To create a graph for the entire Tycho tree, use the
# procedure <code>tychoStandardClasses</code>.
