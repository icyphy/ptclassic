# namespace and within classes it should be sufficient to simply
# call the Tcl command <code>error</code>, rather than calling this
# directly.

#### ErrorMessage
# Issue an error message to the user. To issue an error message, simply call
# the Tcl command <code>error</code>. If the error occured in processing a
# background Tk command, then <code>tkerror</code> will be invoked, which in turn
# will create an instance of this class and pop up a modal dialog to
# inform the user. "Modal" means that nothing further will happen until
# the window is destroyed.  Here is an example:
# <tcl><pre>
# ::tycho::ErrorMessage .xx -text {An error message}
# wm deiconify .xx
# </pre></tcl>
# The stack trace that you will get if you push the stack trace button on this
# example is irrelevant, since no error occurred.

# that the user should see.
