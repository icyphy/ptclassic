#### tkerror
# Inform the user of an error, and return only after the user has
# acknowledged.  This is a procedure in the global scope that will
# handle all background errors in Tk.  Therefore, within the tycho
# namespace and within classes it should be sufficient to simply
# call the Tcl command <code>error</code>, rather than calling this
# directly.

#### silentError
# This utility triggers an error silently.
# It does this by redefining tkerror temporarily, then invoking the
# Tcl error command.  This can be used when cancelling a command where
# the only clean way to unwind the stack is to use the Tcl error facility,
# but where there is no point in informing the user about the error.

#### showStack
# This utility displays the stack in a window. Insert it in code for
# debugging. The argument is displayed on the first line, and can be
# used to give additional information or distinguish between distinct
# instances of the procedure call.

    }

}

# COMPATIBILITY procedure.  This procedure emulates the behavior
# of similarly named procedures in pigi, the predecessor to Tycho.
# The window name in the first argument is ignored (since they bring
# up modal dialogs, the window names are not important anyway).

# COMPATIBILITY procedure.  This procedure emulates the behavior
# of similarly named procedures in pigi, the predecessor to Tycho.

#### ErrorMessage
# Issue an error message to the user. To issue an error message, simply call
# the Tcl command <code>error</code>. If the error occured in processing a
# background Tk command, then <code>tkerror</code> will be invoked, which in turn
# will create an instance of this class and pop up a modal dialog to
# inform the user. "Modal" means that nothing further will happen until
# the window is destroyed.  Here is an example:
# <tcl><pre>
# ::tycho::ErrorMessage .xx -text {An error message}
# wm deiconify .xx
# </pre></tcl>
# The stack trace that you will get if you push the stack trace button on this
# example is irrelevant, since no error occurred.
#
class ::tycho::ErrorMessage {
    inherit ::tycho::Message

    constructor {args} {}

    # Show the stack trace in a window, if there is one.

#### stackTrace
# Show the stack trace in a window, if there is one.
# Note that this stack trace is that associated with the most recent error.
# That error may be one that was caught, and that therefore was never seen
# by the user.  Normally, this method should only be invoked after an error
# that the user should see.

    # Displayer has already given the focus to the stack window. But
    # for some reason, the stack window loses it by the time we get
