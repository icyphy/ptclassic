Tycho includes facilities to compile C and Java files and load them back
into Tycho.  
<H2>Other Tycho Pages</H2>

<H2>Compile Class structure </H2>
The following classes are used to implement the Compiler interface:
<DL>
<DT> <A HREF="../../Compile.itcl"><CODE>Compile</CODE></A>
<DD> The base class that the other Compiler classes inherit from.

<DT> <A HREF="../../CompileC.itcl"><CODE>CompileC</CODE></A>
<DD> This class compiles and loads a C file into the itkwish that is
running Tycho.

<DT> <A HREF="../../CompileJava.itcl"><CODE>CompileJava</CODE></A>
<DD> This class compiles and loads a Java file into the java interpreter
that is running Tycho.  
Note that the binary that is actually running Tycho could be either
<CODE>itkwish</CODE> or the java interpreter.
The <CODE>CompileJava</CODE> class probably
won't work if the binary that is running Tycho is <CODE>itkwish</CODE>.
The <CODE>CompileJava</CODE> class will probably only work if Tycho
was started up with <CODE>tycho -java</CODE>.

</DL>
 <HR>
<H2>Steps to Compile and Load a file</H2>
<OL>
<LI> Check the file for necessary features.
 <br> Exactly what happens depends on what language is being compiled.
For example, when a C file is loaded into Tcl, an initialization
procedure with a specific name is called.

<LI> Determine the name of the makefile.
 <br>The current directory is searched for the following files:
	<OL>
	<LI> <CODE>makefile</CODE>
	<LI> <CODE>Makefile</CODE>
	<LI> A file with the same base as the file being evaluated and
	a <CODE>.mk</CODE> extension.  For example, if the file being
	evaluated is named <CODE>myTclCommands.c</CODE>, then we look for 
	<CODE>myTclCommands.mk</CODE>
	</OL>

If none of the above makefiles are found, then we create a makefile
with the same basename.  The way the makefile is created depends
on whether we are compiling C or Java

<LI> Compile the file.
 <br> Usually, <CODE>make</CODE> is called via the <A HREF="../usersGuides/ExecHelp.html"><CODE>Exec</CODE> class</A>.

<LI> Load the results of the compilation back into Tycho.
 <br>Exactly what happens depends on the language being compiled.

</OL>

<H2>Interactivity</H2>

If the user is compiling and loading many files, then they probably
don't want to hit 'Ok' for every file to be loaded.  However, if a
file fails to compile, the user may want to retry the compilation
after modifying something else.
