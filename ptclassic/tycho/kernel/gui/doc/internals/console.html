<p>
The TclConsole class, derived from <a href="edit.html">Edit</a>,
is a top-level window that provides an interface to the Tcl
<a name=interpreter>interpreter</a>.
The <a href="../usersGuides/ConsoleHelp.html">help window</a>
gives additional information.
<p>
You may create an instance of the TclConsole class as follows:
<tcl><pre>
::tycho::TclConsole .e
.e centerOnScreen
</pre></tcl>
The -text option specifies a welcome message. For example,
<tcl><pre>
::tycho::TclConsole .c -text "A fresh Tcl console\n"
.c centerOnScreen
</pre></tcl>
The <a name="-master option">-master option</a>,
if given a non-zero value, specifies that this is
a "master" console. Closing a master console will close the entire
application (after requesting confirmation).
Moreover, the most recently created TclConsole window that is designated
master will capture <a name="standard output">standard output</a>
generated by the Tcl <a name="puts command">puts command</a>, unless
that output is redirected to a file.
<p>
<a name="ConsoleText class">
<h2>ConsoleText Class</h2>
<p>
The top-level TclConsole class window
is implemented by packing into it a megawidget that implements
the console itself.
This megawidget, the ConsoleText class, can be used
stand-alone inside any other widget or window.
For example, a graphics window could contain a console subwindow.
<p>
We can create an instance of the ConsoleText megawidget in its own top-level
window as follows:
<tcl><pre>
::tycho::TopLevel .t
::tycho::ConsoleText .t.t
.t.t printPrompt ""
pack .t.t
.t centerOnScreen
</pre></tcl>
Notice that you can enter Tcl, Itcl, Tk, and Itk commands into the text window.
Also notice that the "printPrompt" method was used above to create the first
prompt.
To delete the above example:
<tcl><pre>
delete object .t
</pre></tcl>
ConsoleText has a number of options.  For example:
<tcl><pre>
::tycho::TopLevel .p
::tycho::ConsoleText .p.t &#92
    -width 60 &#92
    -scrollbar 0 &#92
    -height 20 &#92
    -text "My own welcome message\n"
pack .p.t
.p.t printPrompt ""
.p centerOnScreen
</pre></tcl>
There are a large number of public methods for ConsoleText.
See the class documentation.
To delete the above example:
<tcl><pre>
delete object .p
</pre></tcl>
