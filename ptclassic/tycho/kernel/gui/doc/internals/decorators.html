<h1><a name="window decorators">Window Decorators</a></h1>
<p>
Tycho provides a set of classes that are added to top-level
windows to perform certain well-defined functions. There are
currently three of these "decorator" classes.

 <P>("Decorator" is perhaps a poor name for this set of classes
since the meaning is very different from the <I>Decorator</I>
object-oriented design pattern.)

</ul>

<h2><a name="MenuBar class">MenuBar Class</a></h2>
<p>
The MenuBar class is a complete application menu bar. (MenuBar
is a subclass of the abstract class MenuSupport, which implements
most of the menu functionality.) The Displayer
top-level window contains a MenuBar object for each View
packed into it. Views are responsible for maintaining their own
menu bars: they each have a method called <code>menubar</code> which
directs commands to its menu bar; each view subclass adds
appropriate entries to the menubar.

 <P>To illustrate the workings of the menu bar, we will just create a
menu bar and pack it into a top-level window. To understand the
Displayer-View machinery, see the documentation for the <A
HREF="view.html">Displayer and View</A> classes. Create a top-level
window and and an empty menubar:

<tcl quiet><pre>
set f [::tycho::autoName .dechtml]
::tycho::TopLevel $f
::tycho::MenuBar $f.mb
pack $f.mb -fill x -expand on
$f centerOnScreen
</pre></tcl>

(The window will appear as a very small rectangle in the center of
your screen.) Now, we'll add a couple of menus to the menu bar:

<tcl quiet><pre>
$f.mb addMenu file -label File
$f.mb addMenu help -label Help -side right -underline 0
</pre></tcl>

Note that the <CODE>Help</CODE> menu is packed to the right of the menu bar.
The <code>-underline</code> option places an underline under the
indicated letter of the label and enables keyboard navigation through
menus.

 <P>The menu bar accesses all menus and menu entries by tag -- that
is, by the first argument you gave when you created the menu.
To add
entries to a menu, call <code>add</code> with the entry label, the
name of the menu to place the entry into, and additional options.  For
example, we'll add a <CODE>Close</CODE> menu choice to the <CODE>File</CODE>
menu and a Tycho Home Page entry to the <CODE>Help</CODE> menu:

<tcl quiet><pre>
$f.mb add command close file -label Close -command {delete object $f}
$f.mb add command home help -label {Tycho Home Page} &#92
	-command {::tycho::File::openContext &#92
	$TYCHO/doc/index.html} &#92
	-underline 0 -accelerator "C-x h"
</pre></tcl>

(Click on the <CODE>File</CODE> and <CODE>Help</CODE> menu buttons to
bring down the menus.)  Note that labels containing spaces must be
bracketed as a list, or the menu bar will get confused -- as in
<code>{Tycho Home Page}</code>.

 <P>The <code>add</code> command takes any options acceptable to the
entries of the Tk <code>menu</code> widget. Three commonly-used
ones are illustrated above: 

<ul>

<li><code>-command</code> is a script which is executed in the
global scope when the menu entry is invoked.

<li><code>-underline</code> indicates the letter of the label to
underline and enables keyboard selection of that entry.

<li><code>-accelerator</code> displays a string next to the menu,
which represents a key accelerator for the menu command. <I>The menu
bar only displays this string: it does not actually bind the command
to the indicated key sequence.</I> (This is an artifact of the way
that Tk works -- we are considering making the menu bar perform the
key bindings as well as displaying the accelerator string.)

</ul>

 <P> You can add a separator to a menu:

<tcl quiet><pre>
$f.mb add separator sep1 help
$f.mb add command foo help -label Foo -command {::tycho::inform Foo!}
</pre></tcl>

 <P>Individual menu entries can be disabled and enabled:

<tcl quiet><pre>
$f.mb disable home
</pre></tcl>

(Pop down the <CODE>Help</CODE> menu: the <CODE>Tycho Home Page</CODE>
entry is greyed out and cannot be invoked.) Whole menus can be
disabled in exactly the same way:

<tcl quiet><pre>
$f.mb disable file
</pre></tcl>

To re-enable disabled menus or entries, just call <code>enable</code>:

<tcl quiet><pre>
$f.mb enable home
$f.mb enable file
</pre></tcl>

For more detailed information on menu bars, see the 
<a href="../codeDoc/MenuBar.html">MenuBar</a> and 
<a href="../codeDoc/MenuSupport.html">MenuSupport</a><br> class
documentation.


<h2><a name="StatusBar class">StatusBar Class</a></h2>
<p>
The StatusBar is a bar designed to be placed along the bottom
of top-level windows. It contains a button to close the window,
an optional field indicating file status (writable, read-only, or
modified), and an area in which short but informative status messages
can be displayed. Usually, the status bar is accessed from a View
class, which has the method <code>statusbar</code> to
direct commands to its status bar.

 <P>To illustrate the operation of the status bar, we will create one
and pack it into a top-level window with a empty frame to give the
window some size:

<tcl quiet><pre>
set fr [::tycho::autoName .dechtml]
::tycho::TopLevel $fr
frame $fr.f -width 300
pack $fr.f -fill x -expand on
::tycho::StatusBar $fr.sb -closecommand {delete object $fr}
pack $fr.sb -fill x -expand on
$fr centerOnScreen
</pre></tcl>

The status bar just created has a command given to it via the
<code>-closecommand</code> option, which deletes the object
when the close button is pressed.
The status bar has a number of other options that control its appearance.
To add a file status display, set the <code>-filestatus</code> to
<CODE>readonly</CODE>, <CODE>writable</CODE>, or <CODE>modified</CODE>:

<tcl quiet><pre>
$fr.sb configure -filestatus readonly
</pre></tcl>

Another one:

<tcl quiet><pre>
$fr.sb configure -filestatus modified
</pre></tcl>

To change the displayed text in the bar:

<tcl quiet><pre>
$fr.sb configure -closetext Quit
</pre></tcl>

To leave some space at the right side of the close button to match
a scrollbar (presumably in some other window in the parent window):

<tcl quiet><pre>
$fr.sb configure -scrollbarpad 1
</pre></tcl>

There is really only one method of interest in the status bar:
<code>puts</code> prints a string to the status region:

<tcl quiet><pre>
$fr.sb puts "A brief but informative message"
</pre></tcl>

To clear the display:

<tcl quiet><pre>
$fr.sb puts ""
</pre></tcl>

Often, printing a string and clearing it are bound to Tk
<CODE>&lt;Enter&gt;</CODE> and <CODE>&lt;Leave&gt;</CODE>
events -- that way the status bar can be used
as a simple help mechanism. 
For example, the toolbar can be set up so that
information about a button is printed in the status bar
when the mouse is moved over that button.



<h2><a name="ToolBar class">ToolBar Class</a></h2>
<p>
The ToolBar is a bar designed to be placed along the top of
top-level windows. It contains a row of buttons that make
commonly-used functions highly visible to the inexperienced
user. It can also display entry widgets below the buttons -- these
are typically used when the temporary nature of the StatusBar
display is not sufficient, or when direct user input is desired
without popping up a dialog box (or both!).

 <P>We will place the toolbar in an empty top-level window
to illustrate its operation. Usually, the toolbar will be
accessed through the <code>toolbar</code> method of the View class.
We will use the same window as for the status bar -- if you have
closed it, go back and create another. Then:

<tcl quiet><pre>
::tycho::ToolBar $fr.tb -statusbar $fr.sb
pack $fr.tb -fill x -expand on -before $fr.f
</pre></tcl>

At first, the toolbar is blank, so you won't actually see anything.
Let's add a couple of buttons to it:

<tcl quiet><pre>
$fr.tb button foo -description "The first button" &#92
       -text "Push Me" &#92
       -command {::tycho::post Thanks!}
$fr.tb button bar -description "The second button"   &#92
       -text "Push Me Too" &#92
       -command {::tycho::post {Thanks again!}}
</pre></tcl>

Notice that the button description is displayed in the
status bar when the mouse is moved over the button. Buttons
can be disabled:

<tcl quiet><pre>
$fr.tb disable foo
</pre></tcl>

And enabled:

<tcl quiet><pre>
$fr.tb enable foo
</pre></tcl>

To add entry widgets to the toolbar, do this:

<tcl quiet><pre>
$fr.tb entry thing "Enter something here" "Start with" {::tycho::post}
</pre></tcl>

If you press the Return key while in the entry widget, the contents of the
widget are appended to the command (the last argument in the above
call) and the command is executed. In this case, a window will
display the entry widget's contents. To get all of the data
in a toolbar, you can use <code>get</code>:

<tcl><pre>
$fr.tb get
</pre></tcl>

The entry widgets can be disabled if you need to prevent the user
from altering the data (why does the appearance not change, though???):

<tcl quiet><pre>
$fr.tb disable thing
</pre></tcl>

And enabled:

<tcl quiet><pre>
$fr.tb enable thing
</pre></tcl>
