<p>
Tycho provides a set of ordinary procedures, defined in the
<CODE>::tycho</CODE> namespace, that serve as simplified interfaces to
the classes used to create messages for the user and ask the user
questions.These are explained here.

<h2><a name="modal dialogs">Modal and Non-Modal Dialogs</a></h2>
<p>

Messages and dialog boxes used to interact with users can be either
<em>modal</em> or <em>non-modal</em>.
A modal dialog is one that prevents the user
from performing any other action (within the application) until the
dialog has been dismissed.
A non-modal dialog is one where the
user can perform other functions before dealing with the dialog.
Both modal and non-modal are useful, and most widgets, which are designed to 
interact with the user,
support both.
<p>
There is unfortunately a hazard with using modal dialogs within Itcl
objects.  Modal dialogs
indirectly call <a name="update"><code>update</code></a>, a Tk utility
that processes pending events, including mouse events. If the modal
dialog is is called from within an Itcl object, directly or
indirectly, it is possible (albeit somewhat unlikely) that the
calling object from being deleted during the call.  This can happen,
for example, because a user hits a key that triggers a dialog and a key
that dismisses a window in rapid succession.
Because of a
defect in at least some versions of Itcl, this can result
in catastrophic failure of the application (a core dump). In Tycho
objects, the <a name="safeEval method"><code>safeEval</code></a>
method should be used to evaluate
any procedure that opens a modal dialog.
This will prevent the deletion of the calling object during the
calls to <CODE>update</CODE>.
If a modal dialog is created from the top level or from a
Tcl procedure that is not itself called from within an Itcl object,
then there is no cause for worry.



<h2><a name="Message procedures">Message Procedures</a></h2>
<p>
There are three basic modal message procedures:
<tcl><pre>
::tycho::inform {This message is created with the inform command}
::tycho::warn {This message is created with the warn command}
tkerror {This message is created with the tkerror command}
</pre></tcl>
All three of these open modal dialogs.
When you click on the above, the dialog boxes appear
one at a time, one after another, rather than all at once.
The <a name="inform procedure"><code>inform</code> procedure</a> posts a simple
message, the <a name="warn procedure"><code>warn</code> procedure</a> posts
a message with an exclamation point bitmap, and the
<a name="tkerror procedure"><code>tkerror</code> procedure</a> posts
a message with an error symbol bitmap and a button for requesting
a stack trace.  The stack trace will correspond to the most recent error.
<p>
You should not use the <code>tkerror</code>
procedure directly, except in very rare
circumstances.  Instead, just call the Tcl command <code>error</code> when
you wish to signal an error.  See
<a href="error.html">Error Handling</a>.
<p>
There are also some non-modal mechanisms for posting messages.
"Non-modal" means that execution continues as soon as the
message is posted.  Here is one simple way to provide information
to the user:
<tcl quiet><pre>
::tycho::post {This message is created with the post command}
</pre></tcl>
Note that with the <a name="post procedure"><code>post</code> procedure</a>
you can leave the message on the screen as long
as you like, and proceed with your work.
Also note that it returns the name of the top-level window created.

<h2><a name="question dialogs">Yes-No Questions</a></h2>
You can ask the user yes-no questions, getting the response back
and taking some action accordingly.  The
<a name="askuser procedure"><CODE>askuser</CODE> procedure</a> asks a
<a name="yes-no questions">yes-no question</a>:
<tcl><pre>
if [::tycho::askuser "Are you awake?"] {
    ::tycho::inform "You said yes!"
} {
    ::tycho::inform "Wake up!"
}
</pre></tcl>
Note that <code>askuser</code> returns 0 if either the user
clicks on the "no" button or if the user dismisses the dialog window
by typing Escape.


<h2><a name="file name dialog">Getting a File Name</a></h2>

The <a name="queryfilename procedure"><code>queryfilename</code> procedure</a>
can be used to query the user for a file name, as in the following example:
<tcl><pre>
::tycho::queryfilename {Choose a file name} default
</pre></tcl>
The single argument is a message to include in the file browser.
If a second argument is given (it is optional),
then it is the default file name.
The returned value is a fully expanded file name.
If the user cancels (with the cancel button or the escape key),
then a null string is returned.

<h2><a name="color dialog">Selecting a color</a></h2>

The <a name="querycolor procedure"><code>querycolor</code> procedure</a>
can be used to query the user for a color name, as in the following example:
<tcl><pre>
::tycho::querycolor {Choose a color} red
</pre></tcl>
The first argument is a message to include in the file browser.
The second argument (which is optional) is the initial color choice.
The returned value is a color name.
If the user cancels (with the cancel button or the escape key),
then a null string is returned.
<p>
<a name="colors">
Note that the returned color name should never be used directly
in Tycho.</a>  Colors cannot be reliably used by name since different
installations understand different color names.  The name can be passed
to <code>::tycho::color</code> to convert the name into a portable
RGB value.
The following example will display the RBG value of the selected color
rather than the color name:
<tcl><pre>
::tycho::color [::tycho::querycolor {Choose a color} red]
</pre></tcl>


<h2><a name="text questions">Questions with Textual Answers</a></h2>

You can prompt the user for a
<a name="typed response questions">typed response</a> with the
<a name="queryinfo procedure"><code>queryinfo</code> procedure</a>.  
For example:
<tcl><pre>
::tycho::queryinfo {Enter a string}
</pre></tcl>
The <code>queryinfo</code> procedure opens a dialog box with an
<a name="entry box queries">entry box</a>
for the user to enter text.  It returns the string that the user
enters, or a null string if the user clicks on the <CODE>Cancel</CODE> button
(or enters a null string).  This procedure takes one required argument,
a label, and two additional optional
arguments, a default string, and a width (in characters) for the
entry box.  For example,
<tcl><pre>
::tycho::queryinfo {Enter a string} default 10
</pre></tcl>

<p>
Much more complicated dialogs are possible using the
<a name="query procedure"><code>query</code> procedure</a>.  
For example, the following call will create a dialog with one of
each of the five kinds of queries:
<tcl><pre>
   ::tycho::query {title text} { &#92
         {line v {v label} foo} &#92
         {lines w {w label} bar 4} &#92
         {radio x {x label} {A B C} A} &#92
         {choice y {y label} {A B C} A} &#92
         {mediated z {z label} red {::tycho::querycolor Choose}}}
</pre></tcl>
This will return a list of the form <CODE>{v</CODE> <i>value</i>
<CODE>w</CODE> <i>value</i> <CODE>x</CODE> 
<i>value</i> <CODE>y</CODE> <i>value</i> <CODE>z</CODE> <i>value</i>}.
The first query is much like the used by the <code>queryinfo</code>
procedure, requesting a single line of text.
The second is similar, except that it has multiple lines
for the textual response.  The third is a collection of radio buttons,
or buttons where the user can only select one.
The fourth is a pop-up menu listing the choices.
The last one is a <a name="mediated queries">mediated query</a>,
which is a query where the response is created by some other widget.
In this case, the <code>querycolor</code> procedure is used to
generate the response.
<p>
The first argument of <code>query</code> is the
label for the entire query, and will appear at the top of the query
window. The second argument is the queries, which is actually a
collection of method invocations for the Query class.
There are currently five relevant methods, shown with their arguments below:
<menu>
<li> <CODE>choice</CODE> <CODE><I>tag label possibilities command</I></CODE>
<li> <CODE>line</CODE> <CODE><I>tag label default</I></CODE>
<li> <CODE>lines</CODE> <CODE><I>tag label default height</I></CODE>
<li> <CODE>radio</CODE> <CODE><I>tag label possibilities default</I></CODE>
<li> <CODE>mediated</CODE> <CODE><I>tag label default command</I></CODE>
</menu>
In addition, all except <CODE>choice</CODE> can accept any number of additional arguments.
These arguments are passed to the widget that implements the query
(a Tk entry, a Tycho <code>Edit</code> object,
a set of Tk radio buttons, or a single Tk
button, respectively).  These additional arguments can be used to
control the appearance of the query.
<p>
The arguments above are explained below:
<DL>
<DT><CODE><I>tag</I></CODE>
<DD> a string that uniquely
     identifies the query. No two queries in the same dialog box
     can have the same tag.
<DT> <CODE><I>label</I></CODE>
<DD> a string that is inserted in the display to the left
     of the query.
<DT> <CODE><I>default</I></CODE>
<DD> the initial value of the query.
<DT> <CODE><I>height</I></CODE>
<DD> the number of lines in a multi-line text query.
     An <code>Edit</code> widget is used, providing
     an emacs-like text editor.
<DT> <CODE><I>possibilities</I></CODE>
<DD> a list of options.  These are the labels
     that appear on each of the radio buttons, or the menu items in the
     choice pop-up menu.
<DT> <CODE><I>command</I></CODE>
<DD> a command to invoke for a mediated query or when the user
     changes the selection in a choice query.  Before
     invoking this command, the current (default) value of the
     query will be appended to the command, separated by a space.
     The command should return the new value of the query.
</DL>

<p>
A third argument can be given to the <code>query</code> procedure:
the width of the entry box in characters.
It is optional and defaults to 40.
