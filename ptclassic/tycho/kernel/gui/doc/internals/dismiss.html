<h1>Dismiss Class</h1>
</a>
<p>
The base class for many working windows in Tycho is Dismiss,
derived from <a href="toplevel.html">TopLevel</a>.
This class simply provides a uniform,
consistent way to handling dismissal of the window.
Here is a simple example:
<tcl><pre>
::tycho::Dismiss .d
wm deiconify .d
</pre></tcl>
There is nothing more to this class at this time.
Click on the DISMISS button to dismiss it.
For compatibility with the emacs convention, the key sequences
C-x k (Control-x followed by k) and C-x 0 will also dismiss the
window.  C-x C-f will open a file browser.  C-x C-c will (after
obtaining confirmation) exit the program.
