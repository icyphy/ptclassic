<p>
The Edit class, derived from <a href="file.html">File</a>,
is a top-level window that contains
a text editor.
To use effectively, you may wish to study the
<a href="../../../../doc/bindings.html">keyboard shortcuts</a>.
It has full capabilities for editing text,
saving files, etc.  The <a href="../usersGuides/EditHelp.html">help window</a>
gives additional information.
<p>
You may create an instance of the Edit class as follows:
<tcl quiet><pre>
set e [::tycho::view Edit]
</pre></tcl>
To read a file into the text widget, try
<tcl><pre>
$e insertFile
</pre></tcl>
There are many public methods associated with this class.
See the class documentation for details.
<p>
This megawidget, the Edit class, can be used
stand-alone inside any other widget or window.
For example, the
<a href="dialogclasses.html#Query class">Query class</a>
uses Edit for multi-line entries.
<p>
Notice that you can enter text into the text window.
To delete the above example:
<tcl><pre>
delete object [$e displayer windowName]
</pre></tcl>
Edit has a number of options.  For example:
<tcl quiet><pre>
set ee [::tycho::view Edit &#92
	 -text "Initial text in the text widget" &#92
	 -readonly 1 &#92
	 -textwidth 60 &#92
	 -scrollbar 0 &#92
	 -textheight 20]
</pre></tcl>
Notice that because of the <CODE>-readonly</CODE> option, you cannot modify
the text.  You can change this, and insert more text as follows:
<tcl><pre>
$ee configure -readonly 0
$ee insertData " Here is some more text"
</pre></tcl>
There are a large number of other public methods for Edit.
See the class documentation.
To delete the above example:
<tcl><pre>
delete object [$ee displayer windowName]
</pre></tcl>
