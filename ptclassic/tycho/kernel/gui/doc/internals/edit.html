<p>
The Edit class, derived from <a href="file.html">File</a>,
is a top-level window that contains
an <a name=emacs>Emacs-like</a> editor with
Emacs-like <a href="../../../doc/bindings.html">key bindings</a>.
It has full capabilities for editing text,
saving files, etc.  The <a href="../usersGuides/EditHelp.html">help window</a>
gives additional information.
<p>
You may create an instance of the Edit class as follows:
<tcl quiet><pre>
set e [::tycho::view Edit]
</pre></tcl>
To read a file into the text widget, try
<tcl><pre>
$e insertFile
</pre></tcl>
There are many public methods associated with this class.
See the class documentation for details.
<p>
This megawidget, the Edit class, can be used
stand-alone inside any other widget or window.
For example, the
<a href="dialogclasses.html#Query class">Query class</a>
uses Edit for multi-line entries.
<p>
Notice that you can enter text into the text window.
If you are an Emacs user, you will find the keystrokes used
for navigating through the text familiar.
To delete the above example:
<tcl><pre>
delete object [$e displayer windowName]
</pre></tcl>
Edit has a number of options.  For example:
<tcl quiet><pre>
set ee [::tycho::view Edit &#92
	 -text "Initial text in the text widget" &#92
	 -readonly 1 &#92
	 -textwidth 60 &#92
	 -scrollbar 0 &#92
	 -textheight 20]
</pre></tcl>
Notice that because of the <CODE>-readonly</CODE> option, you cannot modify
the text.  You can change this, and insert more text as follows:
<tcl><pre>
$ee configure -readonly 0
$ee insertData " Here is some more text"
</pre></tcl>
There are a large number of other public methods for Edit.
See the class documentation.
To delete the above example:
<tcl><pre>
delete object [$ee displayer windowName]
</pre></tcl>
