<h1>TopLevel Class</h1>
</a>
<p>
Top-level windows in Tycho are all derived from a common baseclass that
provides some rudimentary capabilities.
To create a top-level window with a specified geometry, you can use
the following pair of commands:
<tcl><pre>
::tycho::TopLevel .t -geometry 300x300+0+0
wm deiconify .t
</pre></tcl>
Most top-level window widgets in Tycho do not automatically appear
on the screen.  The reason for this is that most widgets are designed
to be building blocks, and when the constructor runs, it can't be sure
whether everything that is going to be packed into the window has been
packed into the window.  Thus, the window is created in withdrawn state
to prevent the visually distracting artifact of a window appearing and
then having widgets added to it.  The
<a name="deiconify method">deiconify method</a> above tells the
window manager to make the window <a name="visibility of windows">visible</a>.
<p>
Alternatively, instead of the "wm deiconify" method,
we could have requested that the window be centered on the screen using
the <a name="centerOnScreen method">centerOnScreen method</a>:
<tcl><pre>
.t centerOnScreen
</pre></tcl>
<p>
You can prevent interactive
<a name="resizing of windows">resizing of the window</a> with the following
command.  Before you execute it, verify that you can interactively
resize the window we have created using whatever mechanism your window
manager supports.  Then do this, use the
<a name="freezeWindowSize method">freezeWindowSize method</a>:
<tcl><pre>
.t freezeWindowSize
</pre></tcl>
and try again to resize.
<p>
You can also move or resize the window by configuring its
<a name="geometry option">geometry option</a>:
<tcl><pre>
.t configure -geometry 100x100-0+0
</pre></tcl>
To <a name="removing windows">remove the window</a>, simply do:
<tcl><pre>
delete object .t
</pre></tcl>
