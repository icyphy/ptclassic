<p>
Tycho's View and Displayer classes act in concert to present a
window to the user containing graphics and text editors, and other
kinds of display. A Displayer is a top-level window; a View is a
widget that can be placed into a Displayer. Displayer is used as-is;
View is an abstract class that is subclassed in order to provide
appropriate functionality. Displayers can contain
more than one View; some Views can themselves contain other Views.

<p><b>Note:</b> Although the Displayer-View architecture is
designed to support multiple view of data within the one
top-level window, this functionality is not yet used anywhere
within Tycho. The rest of this description will only place a single
view into each displayer.

<p>Creating a new Displayer is the same as creating any other
widget:
<tcl><pre>
::tycho::Displayer .d
.d centerOnScreen
</pre></tcl>

You will see an empty displayer containing a
<a href="decorators.html#StatusBar class">status bar</a>.
A view is created as a child of the displayer; for example,
we can create a text editor and place it into its displayer:
<tcl quiet><pre>
::tycho::Edit .d.e
.d showView .d.e
</pre></tcl>

The Edit widget has placed itself into the Displayer and
configured its menubar. To better illustrate this, we'll
just use an empty View. First delete the Edit view:
<tcl><pre>
.d destroyView .d.e
</pre></tcl>


<p>Finally, deleting a Displayer and the Views contained
in it is the same as deleting any other widget:
<tcl><pre>
delete object .d
</pre></tcl>
