The BuildDialog widget allows the user to build documentation and indexes
on platforms that do not have a <code>make</code> binary.
<p>
The BuildDialog widget consists of a set of radio buttons that allow
the user to choose different operations, and a set of regular buttons that
invoke different operations.

<h2>BuildDialog Radio Buttons</h2>
The BuildDialog Radio Buttons allow the user to select an operation to
be performed when the user hits the <code>OK</code> or <code>Build</code>
buttons.  Below are the radio buttons
