<h1>User's Guide to the Edit Class</h1>
<p>
The Edit class in Tycho provides an emacs-like text editor window.
It is derived from the <a href=FileHelp.html>File class</a>, and
therefore inherits all of its features.
Several classes derived from Edit provide specialized editors for a variety
of uses.  All of these share the same emacs-like
<a href="../bindings.html">key bindings</a> for moving
the insertion cursor, modifying text, and paging through a document.
Equivalent commands are also available in the pull-down menus
at the top.
