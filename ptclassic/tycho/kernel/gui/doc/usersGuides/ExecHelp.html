<h1><a name="Exec Dialog">User's Guide to the Exec/Monitor Dialog</a></h1>
<p>
The non-graphical Exec Class in Tycho provides a mechanism for
programmers to execute a process. The graphical Monitor Class inherits 
from Exec to provide a graphical dialog window that can execute a
process in a user specified directory and display the results.

<P><h6>
Currently the Exec/Monitor Dialog uses non-blocking I/O, which is not
supported under Windows.  The Exec/Monitor Dialog also will not work under the
Macintosh.  Consult the tcl <CODE>open</CODE> man page for more
information.
