<p>
The Exec Dialog in Tycho provides a dialog window that can execute a
process in a user specified directory and display the results.

<P>In Tycho0.1.1, the Exec Dialog uses non-blocking I/O, which is not
supported under Windows.  The Exec Dialog also will not work under the
Macintosh.  Consult the tcl <CODE>open</CODE> man page for more
information.

<H2>Exec Dialog Features</H2>
The Exec Dialog contains the following controls

<DL>

<DT> <CODE>Command to Exec:</CODE>
