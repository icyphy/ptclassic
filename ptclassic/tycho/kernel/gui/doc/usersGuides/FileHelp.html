<h1>User's Guide to the Tycho File Class</h1>
<p>
The File class in Tycho is the base class for most editors.
It provides a top-level window with a menu bar at the top.
It also provides some common key bindings that are therefore shared
by all derived classes, and
it handles <a name="auto-save">auto-save</a> and
<a name="crash recovery">crash recovery</a>.
By itself, this class is not very useful;
the derived classes are the ones actually used.
<p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#file access">File Access Commands</a>
<li><a href="#Window menu">Window Menu</a>
<li><a href="#Help menu">Help Menu</a>
<li><a href="#keyboard traversal of menus">Keyboard Traversal of the Menus</a>
</ul>
<p>
<h2><a name="file access">File Access Commands</a></h2>
<p>
The following commands are available in the File menu as well
through key bindings.
<dl COMPACT>
<b><dt>C-x C-f</b><dd>open a file
<b><dt>C-x i</b><dd>insert a file at the cursor
<b><dt>C-x C-s</b><dd>save to the current file name
<b><dt>C-x C-w</b><dd>save to some other file name
<b><dt>C-x p</b><dd>print the contents
<b><dt>C-x C-r</b><dd>evaluate a file (only valid in some derived classes)
<b><dt>C-x k</b><dd>close the window
<b><dt>C-x 0</b><dd>close the window
<b><dt>C-x o</b><dd>move the focus to another window
<b><dt>C-x C-c</b><dd>exit the program
</dl>
<p>
In addition to all of the above, the File menu provides the following
command:
<dl>
<b><dt>Revert</b>
<dd> Revert to the previously saved version of this file.
</dl>
<p>
<h2><a name="Window menu">Window Menu</a></h2>
<p>
File objects have a Window menu in the menu bar.
The menu contains commands to open new, blank editors
for any type of editor that has been registered with the File class.
In addition, all open editors that are associated with named files
are listed.  This makes it easier to find editors that may have been
buried by other windows on the screen.
Note that if the editor is open in another screen of a virtual window
manager, it will not appear when you issue the command in the Window
menu.  Also, if an editor has the name "NoName" associated with it,
it does not appear in the Window menu.  To give it a name, use SaveAs
(in the File menu).
<p>
<h2><a name="Help menu">Help Menu</a></h2>
<p>
The Help menu provides access to the on-line documentation for Tycho.
The "User's Guide" entry in the menu will bring up a user's guide
for the widget in which you invoke the command, if one exists.
The "Index" entry will bring up the master Tycho index.
<p>
<h2><a name="keyboard traversal of menus">Keyboard
Traversal of the Menus</a></h2>
<p>
The mechanism for keyboard traversal of the menus is exactly
that provided in Tk.  Thus, the following explanation is from
the Tk man pages, written by John Ousterhout.
<p>
"The menus can be invoked using the Alt key (sometimes
"Alt Graph") together with the underlined character
in the menu title.  Once the menu is posted, typing
the underlined character in a menu item will invoke it.
The F10 key will post the "File" menu.
<p>
<h2><a name="autosave">Autosave</a> and
<a name="crash recovery">Crash Recovery</a></h2>
<p>
Periodically, if its data has been modified, a File object will save
the data to a file with the same name as the current file but with the
prefix "#auto#".  This file is automatically removed when you save the
modified data.
<p>
If you are running <a href="../running.html#Ptolemy with Tycho">
Ptolemy with Tycho</a>, then Tycho will also attempt to save modified
data when the program crashes.  This is important because Ptolemy
is fundamentally an extensible system, into which users routinely
add their own code, so it is not uncommon in the process of doing
code development to get crashes.  The crash recovery files have
the prefix "#crash".  There is no guarantee that their contents
will be correct, since often the crash occurs due to corrupted data.
