<p>
The File class in Tycho is the base class for most editors.
It provides a top-level window with a menu bar at the top.
It also handles autosave and crash recovery.
Tycho will save the data to a file with the same name as the current
file but with the prefix <CODE>#auto#</CODE>.  This file is
automatically removed when you save the modified data.
<p>
By itself, this class is not very useful;
the derived classes are the ones actually used.
Keyboard <a href="../../../../doc/bindings.html">shortcuts</a> are
provided for many commands, as well as for traversal of the menus.
<p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#version control">Version control</a>
<li><a href="#Window menu">Window menu</a>
<li><a href="#Help menu">Help Menu</a>
<li><a href="#registering an editor">Registering an editor</a>
</ul>

<h2><a name="version control">Version Control</a></h2>
<p>
The version control or
<a name="revision control">revision control</a> mechanism built into
the File class interfaces to either <a name="SCCS">SCCS</a>,
a Unix "source code control system", or
<a name="RCS">RCS</a>, a public domain improvement.
When the <CODE>Revision Control</CODE> command in the <CODE>File</CODE>
menu is invoked, then if the file is already under version control
by either SCCS or RCS, a control panel will appear that permits
the user to check out the file (if it is not checked out),
check in the file (if it is checked out), examine the
version history, or unedit the file (cancel changes made since
the file was checked out).
The version history mechanism displays the comments that were
filed with checkins as well as version numbers and dates.
Double clicking on an older version will cause that version
to be displayed in a new window.
<p>
If the file is not currently under revision control,
then invoking the <CODE>Revision Control</CODE> command will query
the user about whether the file should be placed under revision
control.  The list of revision control systems presented to the
user can be set as an option, but currently includes only SCCS
and RCS, with SCCS being the default.
<p>
Revision control is also used by the
<a name="toggle read-only command"><CODE>Toggle read-only</CODE></a>
command, if the file is already under revision control.
If it is not, then the read-only permissions are simply changed
without the intervention of any revision control system.
<p>
The Tycho development group uses SCCS, and has configured
the options to follow our style.  In particular, when a file
is put under the control of SCCS, it is required to have
"ID keywords", which are strings like <CODE>&#37W&#37</CODE> and
<CODE>&#37G&#37</CODE>.
When a file is checked in, these get converted into the version number
and date.
In addition, in order to support copyright notices, <CODE>&#37Q&#37</CODE>
gets converted into the current year.



<h2><a name="Window menu">Window Menu</a></h2>
<p>
File objects have a Window menu in the menu bar.
The menu contains commands that somewhat duplicate typical window
manager functions, but are provided in order to have convenient key bindings.
It also contains commands to open new, blank editors
for any type of editor that has been registered with the File class.
In addition, all open editors that are associated with named files
are listed.  This makes it easier to find editors that may have been
buried by other windows on the screen.
Note that if the editor is open in another screen of a virtual window
manager, it will not appear when you issue the command in the Window
menu.  Also, if an editor has the name <CODE>NoName</CODE> associated with it,
it does not appear in the Window menu.  To give it a name, use SaveAs
(in the <CODE>File</CODE> menu).



<p>
<h2><a name="Help menu">Help Menu</a></h2>
<p>
The Help menu provides access to the on-line documentation for Tycho.
The <CODE>User's Guide</CODE> entry in the menu will bring up a user's guide
for the widget in which you invoke the command, if one exists.
The <CODE>Index</CODE> entry will bring up the master Tycho index.
<p>






<h2><a name="registering an editor">Registering an editor</a></h2>

<p> Since Tycho is meant to be an extensible
system, it is expected that users will create new editors.
Integrating these editors into Tycho is easy. The code illustrated in
the following example is generally contained in the package load file
of the package containing your editor (see <A
HREF="../../../../doc/packages/index.html">Tycho's package
system</A>), or you can execute it directly into
the Tycho console, or source a file containing at after
you start Tycho.

 <P>
First, you need to create a "mode" for the file type -- this
is much like a file mode in emacs. For example:

<pre>
::tycho::register mode "foo" \
	-command  {::tycho::view EditFoo -file {%s}} &#92
	-viewclass ::tycho::EditFoo \
	-label    {Foo editor} \
	-category "text" \
	-underline 0
</pre>

Here, the arguments to the <CODE>::tycho::register mode</CODE>
command are:

<MENU>

<LI> The first argument is the name of the mode.

<li> The <CODE>-command</CODE> argument is a Tcl command that is
executed when a file is opened in this mode. An occurrence of an
embedded <CODE>%s</CODE> is replaced with the file name before
invoking the command, using the Tcl <code>format</code> command.

<LI> The <CODE>-viewclass</CODE> argument is the class
of your editor.

<li> The <CODE>-label</CODE> argument is a description of the
editor. If it is supplied, then the command will be added to the
<CODE>Window</CODE> menu of all File objects opened in the future
using the value of this description as the menu label. This permits
the user to open a new blank editor of the given class.

<LI> The <CODE>-category</CODE> argument selects the sub-menu of the
<CODE>Windows</CODE> menu into which this editor will be placed.
The standard set of categories is <CODE>text</CODE>, <CODE>graphics</CODE>,
<CODE>tool</CODE>, and <CODE>html</CODE>.

<li> The <CODE>-underline</CODE> argument is the position of the
character in <CODE>-label</CODE> to underline for menu traversal.

</MENU>

 <P>
You also need to associate one or more file extensions with the mode.
For example:
<pre>
::tycho::register extensions "foo" .foo .bar .baz
</pre>

 <P>Now, any file that ends with one of the extensions
<CODE>.foo</CODE>, <CODE>.bar</CODE>, or <CODE>.baz</CODE> will by
default be opened in an <CODE>EditFoo</CODE> widget.  For example, a
Tycho <CODE>Open File</CODE> command on a file called
<CODE>file.foo</CODE> will cause a window containing an instance of
<CODE>::tycho::EditFoo</CODE> to be created, and <CODE>file.foo</CODE>
will be loaded into it.  The syntax of the command that creates the
windows will be:

<pre>
  ::tycho::view EditFoo -file file.foo
</pre>

The name of the widget is generated automatically.  The <a name="-file
option"><CODE>-file</CODE> option</a> must (obviously) be understood
by the editor.  But that is the only constraint on the editor.

  <p> If an editor has a ToolBar, then the <CODE>::tycho::register
mode</CODE> command might look like this:

<PRE>
 ::tycho::register mode "html" \
	-command  {::tycho::view HTML -file {%s} -toolbar 1} \
	-viewclass ::tycho::HTML \
	-label    {HTML Viewer}  \
	-category "html" \
	-underline 5
</PRE>
