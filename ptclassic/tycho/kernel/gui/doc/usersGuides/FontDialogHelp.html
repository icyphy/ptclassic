<p>
The FontDialog in Tycho is a top-level window within
which you can select a font. You will usually get access
to it through the <A HREF="PreferencesHelp.html">preferences manager</A>.

 <P>The window contains three option menus which you can use to set
the font family, size, and style. The <CODE>Screen</CODE> family is a
psuedo-family that maps to some common X fonts such as <CODE>8x13</CODE> and
 <CODE>9x15</CODE>.
There is a display of text in the selected font, and, for the
hackers, the name of the actual font selected. When you make a
change to the selected font, the displayed text changes to that font.


 <P>The font dialog (and the class that is doing the real work
behind the scenes, the <A HREF="../internals/fontmanager.html">font
manager</A>, hide the arcane font specification
that is used by the window system from the user. As part of this,
the font manager will always choose a valid font, regardless of the
specification you give it. For example, if you try and select a
<CODE>Screen</CODE> font in italics, the font manager will display a <CODE>Courier</CODE> font
since there is no italic <CODE>Screen</CODE> font.
