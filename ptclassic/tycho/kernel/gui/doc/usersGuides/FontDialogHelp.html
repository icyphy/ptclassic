<p>
The FontManager in Tycho a top-level window within
which you can select a font.
When you select a font, the alphabet will be displayed in that font.
When you have invoked the font manager from within an editor, the
clicking OK or typing return will set the selected font in the
editor.
<p>
Rather than exposing to the user the arcane font specification
that is used by the X window system, the font manager has five
pull-down menus that can be used to select fonts
by family, size, weight, and style.  Since some of the best
X window fonts do not conform to this partitioning, a
separate menu is provided for selecting miscellaneous fonts
by name.  For example, the 9x15 and 10x20 fonts are particularly
nice screen fonts.
