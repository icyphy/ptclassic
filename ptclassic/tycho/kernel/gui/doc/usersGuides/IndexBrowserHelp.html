<h1>User's Guide to the Tycho Index Browser</h1>
</a>
<p>
The index browser is <a href="ListBrowserHelp.html">list browser</a>
specialized for browsing through lists of index entries in Tycho
documentation.
An index browser can be opened from most Tycho windows through pull-down
help menu.  In this case, the index browser opens the Tycho master
<a name=index>index</a>.
In general, any file with the <a name="extension .idx">extension ".idx"</a>
will be opened using an index browser.
Although the Tycho index browser is designed to be relatively
familiar to most users, it has some unique features.
Here is a summary of helpful hints:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Double clicking on an item will select it and open it.
<li>Tab is used for <a name="index name completion">name completion</a>.
<li>Repeated Tabs will scroll through matching items.
<li>Up and down arrows plus the emacs-like equivalent bindings
can be used to navigate through the list of index items (if you
are using name completion, use these to navigate through the list
of possible completions).
<li>The window can be resized to see more of the items
(use whatever mechanisms your window manager provides).
</ul>
<p>
See <a href="../internals/documentation.html">Tycho Documentation</a>
for instructions on how to create an index.
