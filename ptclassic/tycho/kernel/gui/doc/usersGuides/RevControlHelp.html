<p>
The Tycho Version Control provides a simple interface
for files that have already been placed under RCS and SCCS.
If the file is not under version control, then the user will 
be prompted whether the current file should be placed under RCS or 
SCCS.
<p>
The Edit class provides the following features:
<hr>
<font size=+1>Most Commonly Used Features</font>
<ul>
<li><em>Checkout</em>-
	Under RCS and SCCS, only one file can be checked out by a user.
	Under SCCS, the status of checkin and checkout is determined by 
	the invocation of <tt>sccs info</tt>. Under RCS, the status is
	determined by the read/write permission of the file. When the 
	file is checked out, the user will automatically gain write 
	permission of the file. When the file is checked out, the user
	will only have read permission of the file.
<li><em>Checkin</em>- 
	When a file is checked in, the version control will prompt for
	description associated with the version. The file will be checked
	in, the description and the version will be added to the history,
	and the user will only have read permission of the latest version.
	Under SCCS, the user should include the following tags in the
	comment: "%(tag)%", where (tag) could be either W (file name),
	G (version number and date), or Q (year).
<li><em>Unedit</em>- For a file that is currently checked out, discard 
	any changes that have been made and revert to the version most 
	recently checked in.
</ul>
<hr>
<font size=+1>View History Panel</font>
<ul>
<li><em>View History</em>- This will open up all of the history associated
	with the file, and provide hyperlinks (underlined text) to the 
	older versions. When the hyperlinks are accessed by double click, 
	the Tycho Version Control will retrieve the specified version,
	store it in a temporary file, then display that temporary file
	in an appropriate editor.
<li><em>Diff Checked Files</em>- The user can check the different versions		to compare using this command. A diff editor will pop up and
	color the differences between the files, while leaving the common
	text in default color. When View History is first invoked, by
	default, the two most current files will be checked.
<li><em>Undo Last Checkin</em>- When this is invoked, the most recent check-in
	will be undo. In another word, the user will check out the most
	recent file, and delete the log from history so that he/she can
	continue editing. Beware that the combination of <em>Diff Checked 
	Files</em> followed by an <em>Undo</em> implies erasing the most 
	recent version.
