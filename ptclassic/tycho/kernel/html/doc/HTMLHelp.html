<h1><a name="HTML viewer">User's Guide to the HTML Viewer</a></h1>
<p>
The HTML viewer in Tycho provides a top-level window that
displays formatted HTML.  It is based on the
<a href="../../../lib/html_library/html/help.html">HTML library</a>
written by Stephen Uhler of Sun Microsystems, which supports all the
features of HTML 2.0.
There is currently no support in Tycho for
<a name=HTTP>HTTP</a> hyperlink references, so you cannot
within Tycho directly read documents on the internet, although
this might come in the future.
A <a href="../../../lib/html_library/html/sample.html">sample document</a>
illustrates the HTML tags that are supported.
<p>
The HTML viewer is derived from the <a href=FileHelp.html>File class</a>, and
therefore inherits all of its features.
In addition, it provide a pull-down menu for adjusting the sizes
of the fonts in the display plus a toolbar at the top for invoking
commonly invoked functions. The "File" menu provides the following
commands:
<dl COMPACT>
<b><dt>C-x C-f</b><dd>open a file
<b><dt>C-x C-v</b><dd>switch to viewing another HTML file
<b><dt>C-x s</b><dd>open HTML source using the
<a href="../../../editors/textedit/doc/usersGuides/EditHTMLHelp.html">
HTML editor</a>
<b><dt>C-x p</b><dd>print the contents (not yet implemented)
<b><dt>none</b><dd>reload the file from disk
<b><dt>C-x k</b><dd>close the window
<b><dt>C-x C-c</b><dd>exit the program
</dl>
<p>
The
<a href=../internals/documentation.html>
Tycho documentation policy</a>
explains Tycho-specific
<a href="../internals/documentation.html#HTML extensions">
HTML extensions</a>
and how to write HTML
so that an index can be generated automatically by the
<a href="../internals/documentation.html#indexing documents">
index generator</a>.
Note that hypertext links can be to any type of file,
and based on the file name extension, Tycho will open a context-specific
editor.  Thus, you can have hypertext links to source code,
or to graphical editors.
