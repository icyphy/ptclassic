<p>
The HTML class, derived from <a href="file.html">File</a>,
is a top-level window that renders HTML in a text widget.
It uses the
<a href="../../../lib/html_library/html/help.html">HTML library</a>
written by Stephen Uhler of Sun Microsystems, which supports all the
features of HTML 2.0.

 <P>Currently, there is currently no support in Tycho for 
<a name="HTTP">HTTP</a> hyperlink references,
so you cannot read documents
directly on the internet from within Tycho.  If Tycho encounters a
HTML reference that it does not understand, then Tycho with ask the
user if they want to start up <CODE>Netscape</CODE>. (The Macintosh
does not support <CODE>exec</CODE>, so this will not work on the Mac).
We are working on adding HTTP support to Tycho.

 <P>A <a href="../../../lib/html_library/html/sample.html">sample document</a>
illustrates the HTML tags that are supported.

<p>
The HTML class is used for all
<a href="../../../doc/documentation.html">Tycho documentation</a>.
It supports an extension of HTML with embedded Tcl scripts.
If the user double
clicks on a script, the Tcl script is executed in the global
namespace.
<p>
You may create an instance of the HTML class as follows:
<tcl quiet><pre>
::tycho::view HTML -file $TYCHO/doc/introduction.html
</pre></tcl>
There are many public methods associated with this class.
See the class documentation for details.
<p>
HTML has a number of options.  For example:
<tcl quiet><pre>
set h [::tycho::view HTML &#92
	-data "&lt;h1&gt;Initial header in the HTML widget&lt;/h1&gt;" &#92
	-textwidth 60 &#92
	-scrollbar 0 &#92
	-textheight 20]
</pre></tcl>
By default, an HTML widget is read-only, so
you cannot modify its contents.
You can change this, and read in a file as follows:
<tcl quiet><pre>
$h configure -readonly no
$h insertData " Some &lt;b&gt;More&lt;/b&gt; html"
</pre></tcl>
Notice that Emacs-like <a href="../../../doc/bindings.html">key bindings</a>
can be used to navigate through the text.
There are a large number of other public methods for HTML.
See the class documentation.
To delete the above example:
<tcl><pre>
delete object [$h displayer windowName]
</pre></tcl>
