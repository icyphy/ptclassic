<title>Known Problems</title>
<h1>Missing features</h1>
<ul>
<li>I believe that every tag defined in HTML/2.0 that affects markup
is handled by the library. with the exception of <code>listing</code>
and <code>xmp</code> which are deprecated, and should never be used.
<li>Some html tags, such as <code>link</code> or <code>base</code>
aren't used for rendering, so the library doesn't deal with them.
</ul>
<h1>Bugs</h1>
<ul>
<li>Sometimes too much white space gets added between tags.
<li>On some systems, fonts take a <i>very</i> long time to load the first
time they are referenced, which slows down the viewer until they are 
cached.
<li>The definition terms <code>&lt;dt&gt;</code> can't contain embedded markup.
<li>HTML comments with embedded tags are not handled properly.
<li>The use of unencoded "<code>&gt;</code>" or "<code>&lt;</code>" characters
	inside of parameter lists is prohibited, as it conflicts with the
	common (and unfortunate) convention of <i>forgetting</i> the closing
	quote in parameter values.
</ul>
