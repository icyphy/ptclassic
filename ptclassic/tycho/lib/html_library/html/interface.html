<title>HTML Library Summary</title>
<h1>HTML Library interface Summary</h1>
<p>
This document describes how to use the HTML library.  Unless otherwise
noted, <code>win</code> refers to the name of the text widget to contain
the HTML.
<h2>Primary call-in procedures</h2>
<p>These procedures are the basic application entry points.
<dl>
<dt>HMinit_win {win}
<dd>Initialize a text widget for displaying HTML.  This returns the name of
	the global variable used to store the page state by the library.
<dt>HMreset_win {win}
<dd>Reset a <i>used</i> text widget to a clean state by removing all text
	and page specific text tags and marks.
<dt>HMgoto {win where}
<dd>Either position, or schedule the position of the document at the
	<i>where</i> reference.  Return TRUE if the positioning succeeded.
	A callback to <code>HMwent_to</code> will be made when the positioning
	is completed.
<dt>HMgot_image {handle image}
<dd>Called from the <code>HMset_image</code> callback when an image was
	successfully created. <code>image</code> is the name of a Tk image,
	and <code>handle</code> is the handle passed in by <code>
	HMset_image</code>
<dt>HMparse_html {html cmd start}
<dd>Parse <code>html</code>.  <code>Cmd</code> gets called once for each
	html tag.  <code>Start</code> is a <i>dummy</i> html tag that wraps the
	entire document.  The default value of <code>start</code>, <i>hmstart</i>
	initializes the text widget tag state for a new page.
</dl>
<h2>Primary call-backs</h2>
<p>These are the procedures that the application needs to supply.
<dl>
<dt>HMset_image {win handle src}
<dd>Called when an inline image is first seen. <Code>Src</code> is the
	URL for the image.  The application should create a Tk image, then call
	<code>HMgot_image</code>.
<dt>HMlink_callback {win href}
<dd>Called when the user clicks on a hypertext link, image map, or
	(by default) an isindex selection. <code>Href</code> is the name
	of the hypertext link.
<dt>HMsubmit_form {win param query}
<dd>This is called when the user hits the submit button on a form.
	<code>Param</code> is the list of HTML parameters passed in with the
	FORM html tag, and <code>query</code> is a list whose even elements
	(starting from 0) are field names, and odd elements are the
	corresponding field
	values.  The procedure <code>HMmap_reply</code> may be used
	by the application to convert the list into an HTTP POST query.
<dt>HMmark {tag win param text}
<dd>This is an application hook that, if it exists, gets called each time
	an HTML tag is rendered, just before any tag specific routine is
	called.  It is intended to allow an application to associate
	application specific marks into the text widget, but you can use it
	for anything you like. There is no default implementation, and
	none is required.
<dt>HMtag_XXX {win param text}
<dd>This is generic HTML tag hook, where <code>XXX</code> is the name
	of the html tag (or <code>/XXX</code> for the end tag).  Any html
	tag may have special code that gets run.  Applications may override
	the default library implementations for HTML tags, or add functionality
	for new tags. <code>Param</code> is the html parameter list, and
	<code>text</code> is the name of the variable containing all of the
	plain text up to the next html tag.
</dl><h2>Auxillary state-altering routines</h2>
<p>These procedures man be used by an application to alter some aspects 
of the HTML display.
<dl>
<dt>HMset_indent {win cm}
<dd>Sets the tab-stop for tabbing and lists.
<dt>HMset_state {win args} -update -tab -unknown -stop -size -symbols -insert
<dd>This is the procedural interface to access the internal state of the
	HTML rendering process.  It is intended that anything an application
	might want to change in that state will be done through here.  Currently,
	an application can set the update frequency (update), unknown entity
	character (unknown), global font size adjuster (size), list of
	unordered list symbols (symbols), stop the document rendering
	(stop), or choose a text mark at which to insert the text (insert).
</dl>
<h2>Replaceable Procedures</h2>
<p>
These are library routines that have reasonable default implementations, 
but may be replaced by an application for more specific behavior.
<dl>
<dt>HMlink_setup {win href}
<dd>This gets called once when a hypertext link is first encountered.
	The default implementation arranges to highlight the link upon 
	mouse entry and exit.
<dt>HMwin_install {win item}
<dd>This procedure is called any time an embedded window (<code>item</code>)
	from a FORM is inserted into the text.  The default implementation
	sets the indent level, alignment, and tabbing behavior.
<dt>HMsubmit_index {win param text}
<dd>This is called when submitting ISINDEX tags.  The default calls
	<code>HMlink_callback</code>.
<dt>HMset_font {win tag font}
	This procedure is called to set the text tag <code>tag</code> to the
	font name <code>font</code>, which is just what the default implementation
	does.
<dt>HMwent_to {win where}
<dd>This procedure is called after navigation into the document occurred
	via a fragment reference.  The default implementation flashes the link
	a couple of times.
	
</dl>
<h2>Utility routines</h2>
<p>These procedures are used by the library routines, but can also be used
by the application as needed.
<dl>
<dt>HMmap_reply {string}
<dd>Converts <code>string</code> into application/x-www-urlencoded format.
	for use in HTTP POST queries.
<dt>HMcgiMap {string}
<dd>Converts <code>string</code> from application/x-www-urlencoded format
	into a list of name - value pairs.  This routine is not used by the
	library, but can be used in CGI scripts.
<dt>HMzap_white {data}
<dd>Converts all sequences of white space to a single space character.
<dt>HMmap_esc {text}
<dd>Converts all embedded entity references into their ascii form.
<dt>HMstack {win push list}
<dd>Pushes or pops a text tag (or tags) on to the current tag stacks.
	<code>Push</code> is either <code>{}</code> to <em>push</em> or
	<code>/</code> to <em>pop</em>. <code>List</code> contains an even
	number of elements, grouped in pairs.  The first element in the pair
	is the name of the stack, and the second element is the value to push.
	When <em>pop</em>ping, the <em>value</em> is ignored.
<dt>HMcurrent_tags {win}
<dd>Retrieves the current text tag state by assembling the top elements
	of all of the text tag stacks.
<dt>HMextract_param {param key {val ""}}
	checks for and extracts a <code>key</code> value out of an HTML
	attribute list.  If <code>val</code> is supplied, it names the variable
	that will contain the value of <code>key</code>.  Otherwise,
	The variable <code>key</code> is used.
</dl>
<h2>Primary static data structures</h2>
<p>The HTML library uses some static global arrays that define the
layout policy of various HTML tags.  Applications may change or augment
these arrays to effect the HTML tag to layout policy.
<dl>
<dt>array HMtag_map
<dd>The indeces are HTML tag names.  The value is a list of ordered pairs.
	The even elements (starting from 0) are text tag names,
	and the odd elements are their values.
<dt>array HMinsert_map
<dd>The indexes are HTML tag names.  The value is the amount of white space
	to be added after this tag.
<dt>array HM$win
<dd>This array is used to keep all of the state information used internally
	by the library package for the text
	widget <code>$win</code>.
	Applications may add or modify some elements of this array (with care)
	to alter the operation of the library.
	<ul>
	<li>Array elements that begin with <code>S_</code>
	are <em>not</em> reset by calls to <code>HMreset_win</code>.
	<li>Array elements beginning with <code>T</code> are used by the library
	as a list of text tags, the last element of which is associated with
	the current text.
	</ul>
</dl>
