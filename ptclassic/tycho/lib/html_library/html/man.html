<h1>Web page library manual</h1>
This is a preliminary manual for the <b>Hippo</b> HTML display library
<p>
This HTML library provides the facilities needed to display HTML/2.0
data in a TK text widget.  It supports all of the HTML 2.0 constructs.
<p>
The HTML library is designed to be easy to use for simple applications,
yet provide a flexible framework for sophisticated solutions.
The HTML library is packaged so that all procedures and external variables
are prefixed by <code>HM</code>.  It is safe to run <code>sed</code>
over the HTML library to globally change <code>HM</code> to something else
if needed.
<p>
The HTML library consists of a suite of procedures and data structures which
are used to interface HTML to an application.  For the most part, all of the
data structures are used internally by the HTML library, and may be ignored
by most applications.
<p>
There are tree main types of procedures, <i>call-ins</i>,
<i>call-backs</i>, and <i>helper</i>
procs.  The <i>call-in</i> procs,
supplied by the HTML library,
are called directly by the application
with the appropriate arguments.
The <i>call-back</i> procs are supplied by the application, and called
by the HTML library under the appropriate circumstances, such as when the user
<em>clicks</em> on a hypertext link.  The third class of procedures,
the <i>helper</i> procs, are utility procedures that may be used 
both by the HTML library and in the application's procedures to perform common
HTML related tasks.
<p>
For the simplest use of the HTML library
<ol>
<li>Create a text widget, called <code>.text</code>
<li>Initialize the text widget by calling <code>HMinit_win .text</code>
<li>Put an HTML document into the tcl variable <code>html</code>.
<li>Render the document by calling <code>HMparse_html $html "HMrender .text"</code>
</ol>.
Any time the user <i>clicks</i> on a hypertext link, the HTML library will 
call-back the procedure (which you need to supply):
<pre>
	proc HMlink_callback {win href} { ...}
   		win      The name of the text widget (.text)
   		href     The name of the link
</pre>
Presumably this procedure will figure out how to turn the <i>link</i>
into a tcl variable containing HTML, and then call
<ol>
<li><code>HMreset_win .text</code> to <i>reset</i> the text widget.
<li>Render the document by calling <code>HMparse_html $html "HMrender .text"</code>
</ol>
When the HTML library encounters an inline image while rendering a page, 
it calls the procedure (you supply this one too):
<pre>
	proc HMset_image {handle src}
		handle:  a <i>handle</i> that identifies this image
		src     The name (or url) of the image
</pre>
It is up to the application to fetch the image, and make it into a
TK image, by using a call something like:
<pre>
	image create photo $image_name -file $src
</pre>
Once the image is loaded into TK, the application should call
<pre>
	HMgot_image $handle $image_name
</pre>
where <code>$handle</code> is the token passed to
<code>HMset_image</code> 
and
<code>$image_name</code>
is the name of the TK image.  If, for some reason the image could not
be obtained, you may set <code>image_name</code> to a text string that
will be displayed instead.  If you never call <code>HMset_image</code>
at all, the <i>alt</i> entry in the image parameter list will be
displayed instead.
<h2>Advanced usage</h2>
<p>
Although the procedures outlined below may be sufficient for simple
uses of HTML, sophisticated applications may require finer control over
the workings of the HTML library.
The HTML library is constructed in layers, such tha
<p>
There are two routines that manage navigation into the middle of the
document. When <pre>
	HMgoto $text_widget $where
</pre> is called,
the text view is moved to make the hypertext link <code>$where</code>
visible. A return value of <Code>1</code> indicates success, whereas <code>
0</code> indicates the reference was not found, either because it isn't in
the document, or it hasn't been rendered yet.  In the latter case, the request
is queued until the destination is rendered.  Any time navigation to the
link is sucsessful, <pre>
	HMwhen_to $text_widget $where
</pre> is called.
<p>
The HTML library is programmable in several ways.  This section will
be expanded as time permits.
<ul>
<li>There are procedures available to change the look of the rendering.
Some of the easier ones to use are:
	<dl>
	<code><dt>HMset_indent $text_widget $indent_in_cm
	<dd></code>Sets the indent spacing for list constructs
	<code><dt>HMset_state $text_widget -param value -param value ...
	<dd></code>overrides the default settings for several of the
			display parameters.  This will get fleshed out later on.
	</dl>
<li>Some of the built-in procedures may be replaced entirely by
advanced applications.  A good example is
	<dl>
	<code><dt>HMlink_setup $text_widget $href</code>
	<dd>Which is called every time a hypertext link is
		first seen, to set up the link behaviors.
	</dl>
<li>New procedures may be written that are automatically recognized by
the library (based on their naming convention) and called at appropriate times.
	<dl>
	<code><dt>HMtag_<i>html-tag</i> $text_widget $parameter_list text
	<dd></code>Each HTML tag can have its own procedure that gets called
		automatically when the tag is seen.  New behaviors can be
		associated with tags using this technique.
	</dl>
</ul>
I plan to expand the library interface documentaion,
providing infomation on existing call-backs in future releases.
Some examples may include:
<menu>
<li>Fetching and rendering a document in sections
<li>Managing a multiple document interface
<li>Instantiating new documents inside of existing ones
</menu><p>
