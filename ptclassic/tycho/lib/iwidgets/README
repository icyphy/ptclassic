README: $TYCHO/lib/iwidgets

This is a partial copy of the [incr Widgets] 3.0.0
release. Files in this directory are those that have
been developed or modified locally. The Tycho start-up
file inserts the files in this directory into the
auto_path before the standard [incr Widgets] 3.0.0
directory.

If you need to modify a prerelease 3.0.0 widget and it
isn't in this tree, copy it from
~ptdesign/tcltk/itcl/lib/itcl/iwidgets
and put it under SCCS control. Please let johnr know so he
can keep the release up to date.

JohnR, $Date$
