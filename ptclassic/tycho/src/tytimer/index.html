 <P>TyTimer is a simple extension to Tycho that adds a real-time
timer. The timer is designed for use with Tycho's <A
HREF="../../kernel/doc/codeDoc/Scheduler.html"><code>Scheduler</code></A>
class, and should not be used other than in the style documented in
the Scheduler documentation. The package has both a C interface for
use by other C packages, and a Tcl interface for use by "tasks" in
Tcl.

 <P>To run a demonstration of the timer as used by the scheduler:
<tcl quiet><pre>
    source $tycho/src/tytest/testtask.tcl
</pre></tcl>

The top number is the counter incremented by the C task; the bottom
one is the counter incremented in Tcl.  To more clearly see the
interleaving of these two tasks:

<tcl quiet><pre>
    ::tycho::timer period 200
</pre></tcl>

<h2>::tycho::timer</h2>

<P><code>::tycho::timer</code> is a Tcl procedure that manipulates and
queries the real-time timer.  To ensure that it is in the
<code>::tycho</code> namespace, always load the tyEvent package with
<a
href="../../kernel/doc/codeDoc/Loader.html"><code>::tycho::loadIfNotPresent</code></a>. It
accepts the following argument formats:

<dl>
 <P><dt><b>::tycho::timer elapsed</b>

<dd>Return 1 if the timer is not running. Note that, if the timer
has not been started, 1 will be returned anyway. A Tcl script can use
this to find out when the timer has stopped. Note that there is no way
for a Tcl script to be notified asynchronously: it <I>must</I> use this
procedure to query the timer. The overhead is very low -- lower than
reading the value of a Tcl variable, in fact!

 <P><dt><b>::tycho::timer period</b> <I>?period?</I>

<dd>Get or set the timer period. If <I>period</I> is given, the timer
period is set to <I>period</I> milli-seconds; if not, the current
period is returned.

 <P><dt><b>::tycho::timer start</b> <I>?period?</I>

<dd>Start the timer. If <I>period</I> is given, the timer
period is set to <I>period</I> milli-seconds; otherwise, the
previously set value if used. When the package is first loaded, the
period is set to 20 ms.

 <P><dt><b>::tycho::timer stop</b>

<dd>Stop the timer. This should be called by a Tcl task that
finishes it processing before its time is up.


</dl>

<h2>C Functions</h2>

The C functions are provided to allow a C module to cooperate
with the Tycho scheduler. A module that implements a C task
must include a callback that performs its processing. For best
efficiency, this callback must start the timer, and, each time
through its loop, check whether the timer has elapsed. When it
has, it must return. See the Scheduler documentation.

<dl>
 <P><dt>void <b>Ty_TimerPeriod</b> ( int <I>period</I> )

<dd>Set the timer period, where <I>period</I> is in milli-seconds.
When the package is loaded, the period is set to 20 ms. C tasks
should not normally set the period.

 <P><dt>void <b>Ty_TimerStart</b> ( )

<dd>Start the timer running. The timer will elapse with the period
previously set.

 <P><dt>void <b>Ty_TimerStop</b> ( )

<dd>Stop the timer running. This should be called by a task
that terminates before its given time is up.

 <P><dt>int <b>Ty_TimerElapsed</b> ( )

<dd>Return 1 if the timer has elapsed, or 0 if it has not. Tasks
should call this once each time through their "loop" to
test whether their time is up.

 <P><dt>void <b>Ty_DoAllEvents</b> ( )

<dd>If the timer has elapsed, process all pending Tk events.
This is provided for C programs that are structured as a
single loop that runs forever or until completion, without
regard to the Tycho scheduler. Such a program should periodically
call Ty_DoAllEvents to ensure that Tk events are processed. This
style of C module is strongly discouraged, since it will not
allow the Tycho scheduler to operate.
