<h2>Graphic equalizer demonstration</h2>

Welcome to the 10 band Graphic Equaliser Demo! This demo consists of 
10 band-pass filters with center frequencies spaced out at octaves.
This demo illustrates the use of Ptolemy to develop a CD-stereo system!

<P>
<b> General information </b>


 <P> As for the other audio demos, this application 
controls the Sun Audio device. By default, the Ptolemy universe that 
created it configures the device to run stereo at 44.1 kHz with 
16-bit linear encoding. 

<P>
The demo consists of 10 band-pass filters with center frequencies spaced
out by octaves. There is a single control panel with control over the 
gain of each band-pass filter, and record and play volumes and balance.

</b>Controls</b>
<dl>

<dt>Input and output selectors

<dd>The input and output selectors do the obvious thing. Or, at least,
they would if they worked.

<dt>Rec

<dd>Controls the gain on the input. For CD source, this should really
be down quite low to avoid clipping.

<dt>Bal

<dd>Controls the balance of the output signal. Negative numbers are
left, positive are right.

<dt>Band-pass filters

<dd> Control the gain for each of the filters.
