The <CODE>typt</CODE> package encapsulates the Tycho/Ptolemy
interface.  The Ptolemy distribution includes the Tycho distribution,
so if you have Ptolemy, then you should Tycho.  However, you can have
Tycho without Ptolemy.  The best way to check is to see if the
<CODE>$PTOLEMY</CODE> environment variable is set, and
<CODE>$PTOLEMY/copyright</CODE> is a readable file.

<h4>1.1  What is Ptolemy?</h4>

 <p>The ambitious objectives of the Ptolemy project include most aspects
of designing signal processing and communications systems, ranging
from designing and simulating algorithms to synthesizing hardware and
software, parallelizing algorithms, and prototyping real-time systems.

 <p>The Ptolemy software is a system-level design framework that allows
mixing models of computation. In designing digital signal processing
and communications systems, often the best available design tools are
domain specific. The tools must be able to interact. Ptolemy allows
the interaction of diverse models of computation by using the
object-oriented principles of polymorphism and information hiding.
For example, using Ptolemy, a high-level dataflow model of a signal
processing system can be connected to a hardware simulator that in
turn may be connected to a discrete-event model of a communication
network.

 <p>Since the Ptolemy project began in 1990, numerous advances in design,
simulation, and code generation have occurred. Recent enhancements of
the Ptolemy project have been in the realms of dataflow modeling of
algorithms, synthesis of embedded software from such dataflow models,
animation and visualization, multidimensional signal processing,
managing complexity by means of higher-order functions,
hardware/software partitioning, and VHDL code generation.  In 1993,
the Ptolemy project joined the Advanced Research Projects Agencies
(ARPA) RASSP project as a technology base developer.

 <p>Ptolemy has been used for a broad range of applications including
signal processing, telecommunications, parallel processing, wireless
communications, network design, radio astronomy, real time systems,
and hardware/software co-design.  Ptolemy has also been used as a
laboratory for signal processing and communications courses.
Currently Ptolemy has hundreds of users in hundreds of sites, in
industry, academia, and government.
