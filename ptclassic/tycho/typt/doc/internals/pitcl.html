<h1>Pitcl interface to Ptolemy</h1>
<a name="pitcl interface to Ptolemy">
<p>
Author: Edward A. Lee (eal@eecs.berkeley.edu)
<p>
The Tcl commands defined here implement an interface to the Ptolemy
kernel that is significantly richer than the older <code>ptcl</code> interface.
Normally, these commands should not be used directly. Use instead
the class interface defined in the ::ptolemy namespace.
<p>
The commands are designed to expose most of functionality of the
kernel at the Tcl level, although at this point the facilities are
still incomplete. In certain cases, the commands are designed to try
to hide blemishes in the design of the kernel, providing a more
sensible interface. All commands are defined in the ::pitcl
namespace, except the <code>matlab</code> and <code>mathematica</code> commands, which are
defined in both the global namespace and the ::pitcl namespace.
<p>
Because interaction with Itcl is not as rich as it might be, this
implementation preserves from its predecessor the notion of a
current galaxy and current universe. This seems to be the simplest
approach, and is hidden from the user by the classes in the
::ptolemy namespace. For commands that operate on a block, the block
can usually be a star, galaxy, universe, wormhole, or target. Names
of blocks can take any of the following forms:
<ol>
<li><i>name</i>
<li><i>name1.name2</i>
<li><i>name1.name2...nameN</i>
<li><i>.name</i>
<li><i>.name1.name2</i>
<li><i>.name1.name2...nameN</i>
<li> this
<li> target
</ol>
<p>
The first can specify a member of the current galaxy, a master star,
a master galaxy, or a target (names conflicts are resolved in that order).
The second can specify a star within a galaxy within the current galaxy,
or a star or galaxy within a master galaxy.
The third is just the obvious generalization of this.
The fourth specifies a universe.
The fifth specifies a block (star or galaxy) within a universe.
The sixth is the obvious generalization.
The seventh specifies the current galaxy, and the last specifies
the current target.
<p>
Remaining to be done:
<ul>
<li> begin without init causes a core dump.
<li> check aliasing mechanism interaction with HOF.
<li> Need a way to invoke the go method of stars.  Generalize run.
<li> Also need a method to just initialize portholes.
<li> Need a way to get types of portholes, states.
<li> Eliminate curtarget, curuniverse.  Leave only curgalaxy, curdomain.
<li> Provide a way in the naming scheme to address a domain: e.g. SDF:Ramp.
</ul>
<p>
<a name="addBlock pitcl command">
<h2>addBlock</h2>
</a>
<p>
<b>Usage:</b> addBlock <i>name</i> <i>class</i>
<p>
Create a new instance of star, galaxy, or wormhole. The specified
block name may be absolute or relative to the current galaxy, unless
it is a universe, in which case it must be absolute. I.e., it must
begin with a leading period. The galaxy within which the block is to
be created must exist or an error is triggered. An error is also
triggered if the block already exists.
<p>
<a name="addState pitcl command">
<h2>addState</h2>
</a>
<p>
<b>Usage:</b> addState <i>statename</i> <i>type</i> <i>initvalue</i>
<p>
Create a new state for a galaxy or universe. The specified
state name may be absolute or relative to the current galaxy.
<p>
NOTE: Currently this is restricted to adding states to galaxies and
universe. It should be generalized to add states to arbitrary blocks.
<p>
<a name="addUniverse pitcl command">
<h2>addUniverse</h2>
</a>
<p>
<b>Usage:</b> addUniverse <i>name</i> <i>domain</i>
<p>
Create a new, empty universe. The name can begin with a period (as
in ".foo") or can omit the period (as in "foo"). In either case, the
full name of the resulting universe has a leading period (".foo").
If a universe with the given name already exists, it is cleared. The
second argument is the domain of the new universe.
<p>
<a name="aliasDown pitcl command">
<h2>aliasDown</h2>
</a>
<p>
<b>Usage:</b> aliasDown ?-deep? <i>portname</i>
<p>
Return the full name of the port that is aliased to the specified galaxy
port.  If there is none, return an empty string.  If the -deep option
is given, then return the bottom-level port, which is always a star port.
Otherwise, just return the next level down.
<p>
<a name="aliasUp pitcl command">
<h2>aliasUp</h2>
</a>
<p>
<b>Usage:</b> aliasUp ?-deep? <i>portname</i>
<p>
If the -deep option is not given, return the full name of the galaxy
port that is aliased to the specified port at the next level up in the
hierarchy, or an empty string if there is none. If the -deep option
is given, then return the top-level galaxy port, which may in fact be
the same as the specified port if that port is already at the top level.
<p>
NOTE: If the specified port is a plain port within a multiport, the
returned port may be a plain port within a multiport one level up in
the hierarchy.  This port name can be used to disconnect, but not
to recreate the topology.
<p>
<a name="begin pitcl command">
<h2>begin</h2>
</a>
<p>
<b>Usage:</b> begin <i>blockname</i>
<p>
Invoke the begin method of the specified block.
The block must be a star, universe, or wormhole.
This must be called after <code>init</code>.
<p>
NOTE: Ptolemy Universes don't actually have begin methods.  This is an
oversight.  We query for the target and invoke its begin method here.
<p>
FIXME: Calling <code>begin</code> without <code>init</code> causes a core dump.
<p>
<a name="blocks pitcl command">
<h2>blocks</h2>
</a>
<p>
<b>Usage:</b> blocks ?-fullname? ?-deep? ?<i>blockname</i>?
<p>
Return a list of blocks contained by the specified block.
If the -fullname option is given, the names in the returned list
have the form _.universe.galaxy...galaxy.block_, giving the exact
unique name of each block, with a leading period.
If the -deep option is given, then recursively descend into
galaxies, adding their blocks to the list, rather than listing
the galaxy.  Thus, all blocks returned will be stars.  Note that
probably makes no sense to use the -deep option without the
-fullname option, since the names may not end up being unique.
<p>
If no blockname is given, then the current galaxy is used.
If the argument is the name of a star (and hence contains no
blocks), then return an empty string.
<p>
<a name="clear pitcl command">
<h2>clear</h2>
</a>
<p>
<b>Usage:</b> clear ?<i>univname</i>?
<p>
Delete all blocks in the specified universe, or if none is specified,
the current universe.  The target is also reset to the default target.
<p>
<a name="connect pitcl command">
<h2>connect</h2>
</a>
<p>
<b>Usage:</b> connect ?-bus <i>buswidth</i>? ?-note <i>annotation</i>? <i>srcport</i> <i>dstport</i>
<p>
Form a connection between two ports.  The ports are given by dotted
names that can be absolute (beginning with a period) or relative to the
current galaxy.
If a<i>buswidth</i>option is given, then it specifies the number of parallel
connections to make.  If the<i>annotation</i>option is given, the annotation
is recorded on the connection.  Such annotations are used, for example,
in dataflow domains to specify the number and values of initial tokens that
are put on an arc.  For such domains, the<i>annotation</i>argument
is a list giving the values of initial tokens that will be put on the arc.
<p>
<a name="connected pitcl command">
<h2>connected</h2>
</a>
<p>
<b>Usage:</b> connected ?-deep? <i>portname</i>
<p>
Return a list of ports to which the given port is connected, or an
empty list if it is not connected. The full name of each port is
returned. If the given port is the alias of a galaxy port and the
-deep option is not given, then the galaxy port name is reported as
{<code>aliasUp</code> _portname_}. It is possible for a multiport to have both
an upward alias and a connection, in which case, both are returned.
If the -deep option is given, then star ports
are always returned, never galaxy ports. That is, the star port to
which the given port is ultimately connected to is returned. If the
name of a multiport is given, this method returns a list of all the
ports connected to the multiport.
<p>
NOTE: If the far side port is a multiport, then the specific port
within that multiport to which we are connected is returned.  This
is probably not exactly the information originally used to create the
connection, since the connect command accepts a multiport name, and
creates ports within that multiport as needed.
However, the information returned here is exactly what is needed to
recreate the exact the topology, since if a multiport is given in a
connect command, there is no control over which specific port is used
for the connection.
<p>
<a name="cont pitcl command">
<h2>cont</h2>
</a>
<p>
<b>Usage:</b> cont <i>univname</i> ?<i>stoptime</i>?
<p>
Continue an execution of a universe until the specified stop time.
What this time means depends on the domain. In SDF, for example, it
gives the number of iterations of a complete schedule. In DE, it
gives the simulated time after which no more events will be
processed. If no argument is given, then the stop time is taken to
be unity. As a side effect, the current galaxy is set to the
universe being run.
<p>
<a name="currentGalaxy pitcl command">
<h2>currentGalaxy</h2>
</a>
<p>
<b>Usage:</b> currentGalaxy ?<i>name</i>?
<p>
Return the full name of current galaxy or universe if no argument is
given. If a name is given and a galaxy or universe exists with that
name, make that the current galaxy. If there is no such galaxy,
return an error.
<p>
<a name="defGalaxy pitcl command">
<h2>defGalaxy</h2>
</a>
<p>
<b>Usage:</b> defGalaxy <i>galname</i> <i>domain</i> ?{<i>galaxy-building-commands</i>}?
<p>
Define a master galaxy. The first argument is the name of the
galaxy, i.e. the name that is registered on the knownBlocks list for
use by <code>addBlock</code>. The second argument is the domain of the galaxy.
The galaxy can only be used in this domain, and the inside of the
galaxy is also in this domain; to define a wormhole (a galaxy that
is used in a domain different from its internals), use the
<code>defWormhole</code> command. The third argument is a set of galaxy
building commands. If it is not given, an empty galaxy is defined.
Otherwise, the commands are executed in the ::pitcl namespace to
construct the galaxy. Any pitcl commands can be included.
Note that if errors occur during the execution
of these galaxy defining commands, then a partially constructed
galaxy will be on the knownBlocks list.
<p>
<a name="defWormhole pitcl command">
<h2>defWormhole</h2>
</a>
<p>
<b>Usage:</b> defWormhole <i>wormname</i> <i>outerdomain</i> <i>innerdomain</i> <i>target</i> ?{<i>galaxy-building-commands</i>}?");
<p>
Define a master wormhole. The first argument is the name of the
wormhole, i.e. the name that is registered on the knownBlocks list
for use by <code>addBlock</code>. The second argument is the external domain of
the wormhole. This is the domain within which the wormhole can be
used. The third argument is the internal domain of the wormhole.
This can be the same as the outer domain, and a wormhole will still
be created. The fourth argument is the name of the target.  If this is
an empty string, then the default target for the inner domain will be
used.  The final (optional) argument is a set of galaxy building
commands. If it is not given, an empty wormhole is defined.
Otherwise, the commands are executed in the ::pitcl namespace to
construct the wormhole. Note that if errors occur during the
execution of these wormhole defining commands, then a partially
constructed wormhole will be on the knownBlocks list.
<p>
NOTE: In the predecessor interface, ptcl, defgalaxy was used for
wormholes and galaxies. But that approach relied far too much on on
the current state, and precluded incremental construction of
wormholes.
<p>
<a name="galaxyPort pitcl command">
<h2>galaxyPort</h2>
</a>
<p>
<b>Usage:</b> galaxyPort <i>portname</i> <i>aliasport</i>
<p>
This procedure establishes an "alias" relationship between a galaxy
port and a port in a block within the galaxy.  The first argument is
the name of the galaxy port.  If no port with that name exists, it is
created.  The second argument is the name of a block port within the
galaxy.
<p>
NOTE: This procedure replaces the <code>alias</code> command in PTcl.
Also note that this procedure could be greatly simplified by
bypassing the InterpGalaxy::alias method.  We use that method
only because it registers the operation on the "actionList" for
later cloning of the galaxy.  If the cloning mechanism is simplified,
then this implementation can probably be simplified.
<p>
<a name="getAnnotation pitcl command">
<h2>getAnnotation</h2>
</a>
<p>
<b>Usage:</b> getAnnotation <i>portname</i>
<p>
Return the annotation created with the <code>-note</code> option for a given port.
If no annotation was specified, return an empty string.
<p>
NOTE: If a multiport is passed in, this method returns an empty string,
indicating no annotation. Is this what we want?
<p>
<a name="getClassName pitcl command">
<h2>getClassName</h2>
</a>
<p>
<b>Usage:</b> getClassName ?<i>blockname</i>?
<p>
Return the class name of the specified block, or if none is
specified, of the current galaxy. Note that the class name of a
galaxy is the name of the master galaxy from which it was originally
cloned, or if the galaxy is a master (on the KnownBlocks list), then
its own name. The class name of a Ptolemy star has the domain name
as a prefix, as in "SDFRamp".
<p>
<a name="getData pitcl command">
<h2>getData</h2>
</a>
<p>
<b>Usage:</b> getData ?-geo? <i>portname</i>
<p>
Return the data buffered in the port, or if the -geo option is given,
the data buffered on the geodesic.  The data is returned as a list of
items, where each item is a string constructed using the <code>print</code> method
of the particle.  If there is no data, an empty string is returned.
<p>
NOTE: Because of flaws in the design of the Ptolemy kernel, without
the -geo option, only the current particle (that accessed with
operator %0) is returned. Other particles in the port are ignored.
<p>
FIXME: This procedure has only been tested in the SDF domain.
In particular, the -geo option is unlikely to yield anything useful
in other domains.
<p>
<a name="getDescriptor pitcl command">
<h2>getDescriptor</h2>
</a>
<p>
<b>Usage:</b> getDescriptor ?<i>blockname</i>?
<p>
Return the descriptor of the specified block, or if none is specified,
of the current galaxy.
<p>
<a name="getDomain pitcl command">
<h2>getDomain</h2>
</a>
<p>
<b>Usage:</b> getDomain ?-inside? ?<i>blockname</i>?
<p>
Return the domain of the specified block, or if none is
specified, of the current galaxy.  The domain returned by default is
the one within which the block is designed to work.  Thus, for a wormhole,
it will not be the inside domain, but rather the outside domain.  To get
the inside domain of a wormhole, use the -inside option.  This option
is ignored if the block is not a wormhole.
<p>
<a name="getFullName pitcl command">
<h2>getFullName</h2>
</a>
<p>
<b>Usage:</b> getFullName ?<i>blockname</i>?
<p>
Return the full name of the specified block, or if none is
specified, of the current galaxy.  The full name begins with a period,
followed by the universe name, followed by parent galaxy names separated
by periods, followed by the final block name.
<p>
<a name="getParent pitcl command">
<h2>getParent</h2>
</a>
<p>
<b>Usage:</b> getParent ?<i>blockname</i>?
<p>
Return the full name of the parent of the specified block, or if
none is specified, of the current galaxy. If the specified block is
an instance of a star or galaxy, then the full name begins with a
period, followed by the universe name, followed by parent galaxy
names separated by periods, followed by the final block name. If the
specified block is a universe, then return ".". If the specified
block is a master star or galaxy, then return the empty string. If
the specified block does not exist, then return an error.
<p>
<a name="getSchedule pitcl command">
<h2>getSchedule</h2>
</a>
<p>
<b>Usage:</b> getSchedule ?<i>blockname</i>?
<p>
Return the schedule of the specified universe, or if none is specified,
of the current universe.  Note that it is necessary to invoke <code>init</code>
before there is a schedule.  If <code>init</code> has not been invoked, then
return an error. The format of the returned schedule is as follows:
<pre>
&lt;schedule&gt; ::= { ( &lt;entry&gt; )+ }
<p>
&lt;entry&gt;    ::= { scheduler &lt;string:scheduler_identifier&gt; }
             | { galaxy &lt;string:galaxy_or_universe_name&gt; }
             | { target &lt;string:target_name&gt; }
             | { numberOfProcessors &lt;int:numprocs&gt; }
             | { numberOfStars &lt;int:numstars&gt; }
             | { numberOfStarOrClusterFirings &lt;int:sizeofDAG&gt; }
             | { makespan &lt;int:makespan&gt; }
             | { totalIdleTime &lt;int:idletime&gt; }
             | { utilization &lt;float:utilization&gt; }
             | { preamble &lt;schedule&gt; }
             | { cluster &lt;schedule&gt; }
             | { cluster &lt;string:name&gt; &lt;schedule&gt; }
             | { assign &lt;string:token&gt; &lt;string:value&gt; }
             | { fire &lt;star&gt; }
             | { fire &lt;star&gt; &lt;f_info&gt; }
             | { idle &lt;int:idletime&gt;}
             | { processor &lt;string:name&gt; &lt;schedule&gt; }
             | { repeat &lt;int:repetitions&gt; &lt;schedule&gt; }
             | { &lt;string:annotation&gt; &lt;schedule&gt; }
             | { &lt;string:annotation&gt; &lt;schedule&gt; &lt;string:endannotation&gt;}
<p>
&lt;star&gt;     ::= send
             | receive
             | &lt;string:star_name&gt;
<p>
&lt;f_info&gt;   ::= { ( &lt;f_entry&gt; )+ }
<p>
&lt;f_entry&gt;  ::= { exec_time &lt;int:exec_time&gt; }
             | { start_row &lt;int:start_row_index&gt; }
             | { start_col &lt;int:start_col_index&gt; }
             | { end_row &lt;int:end_row_index&gt; }
             | { end_col &lt;int:end_col_index&gt; }
             | { &lt;string:label&gt; &lt;string:value&gt; }
</pre>
The notation "( &lt;<em>name</em>&gt; ) +" means one or more items
of type <em>name</em>.
The notation "&lt;<em>type</em>:<em>description</em>&gt;" means
an item of the given type and description.
The braces ("{" and "}") are all part of the format,
and are included to make the string trivial to parse in Tcl.
<p>
Note that all entries are optional, and the list will inevitably
grow as we add more schedulers.  Some are used only by specific
schedulers.  For instance, the "assign" item is used by BDF to
record a value that affects the schedule. Thus a tool that uses any of
this information
to display a schedule cannot count on any item being present.  It has to fail
gracefully if it does not know how to display the schedule.
The last two items of type "entry" can use any string as an identifier.
This makes the format flexible, so that it can support new schedulers.
I believe all schedule visualization tools should fall back on
a textual schedule display if they cannot represent the given
information, or necessary information is missing.
So for example, one way to write
the gantt tool would be to search the schedule for annotations that
it does not recognize.  If it finds any, display the schedule textually.
Otherwise, draw a gantt chart.
<p>
The &lt;f_entry&gt; items allow the scheduler to give additional
information about the schedule. Anything is allowed here, but
the specific items listed are used by parallel CG schedulers and
the MDSDF scheduler.
<p>
For example,
<pre>
{
  { scheduler "T.C. Hu's Parallel Scheduler"}
  { galaxy foo}
  { numberOfProcessors 2}
  { processor 1 {
     { totalIdleTime 20 }
     { target NOW }
     { fire starA { exec_time 5 } }
     { fire starB { exec_time 5 } }
  }}
  { processor 2 {
     { fire starC { exec_time 25 } }
     { fire starD { exec_time 5 } }
  }}
  { totalIdleTime 20}
  { makespan 30}
  { utilization 66.66}
}
</pre>
Here is a simpler example:
<pre>
{
  {fire starA}
  {fire starB}
  {fire starC}
}
</pre>
<p>
<a name="getTarget pitcl command">
<h2>getTarget</h2>
</a>
<p>
<b>Usage:</b> getTarget ?-inside? ?<i>blockname</i>?
<p>
Given a block, return the name of its target. This procedure is most
useful for blocks that are universes and wormholes when the -inside
option is given. In this case, it returns the name of the target
that controls the invocation of the blocks inside the universe or
wormhole. Without the -inside option, it returns the name of the target
that controls the invocation of the specified block (its outside target).
However, this name will always be a null string before the universe has
been initialized.
<p>
<a name="init pitcl command">
<h2>init</h2>
</a>
<p>
<b>Usage:</b> init ?<i>blockname</i>?
<p>
Initialize the specified block, or if none is specified, the current
galaxy. This causes the states and portholes to be initialized and,
for stars, universes, and wormholes, the setup method to be run. In
addition, if the block is a universe or a wormhole, then the target
is initialized. In statically scheduled domains, initializing the
target causes the schedule to be computed. If a halt is requested or
an error occurs during the initialization, then return an error (so
that no script continues assuming the block has been initialized).
Note that the begin method is not invoked. That should be explicitly
invoked after this initialization.
<p>
<a name="initState pitcl command">
<h2>initState</h2>
</a>
<p>
<b>Usage:</b> initState <i>statename</i>
<p>
Initialize a state.  This causes the initial value to be evaluated
and the current value set to the initial value.
<p>
<a name="isGalaxy pitcl command">
<h2>isGalaxy</h2>
</a>
<p>
<b>Usage:</b> isGalaxy <i>blockname</i>
<p>
Return 1 if the specified block is a galaxy.  Return 0 otherwise.
A wormhole is not galaxy for these purposes, since normally you cannot
see inside.
<p>
<a name="isMultiPort pitcl command">
<h2>isMultiPort</h2>
</a>
<p>
<b>Usage:</b> isMultiPort <i>portname</i>
<p>
Return 1 if the specified port is a multiport.  Return 0 otherwise.
A multiport in Ptolemy is a port that contains any number of other ports.
<p>
<a name="isWormhole pitcl command">
<h2>isWormhole</h2>
</a>
<p>
<b>Usage:</b> isWormhole <i>blockname</i>
<p>
Return 1 if the specified block is a Wormhole.  Return 0 otherwise.
A Wormhole in Ptolemy is a star that contains a galaxy.
<p>
<a name="knownBlocks pitcl command">
<h2>knownBlocks</h2>
</a>
<p>
<b>Usage:</b> knownBlocks ?<i>domain</i>?
<p>
Return a list of the available blocks in the specified domain, or (if no
domain is given) the current domain.
<p>
<a name="knownDomains pitcl command">
<h2>knownDomains</h2>
</a>
<p>
<b>Usage:</b> knownDomains
<p>
Return a list of the available domains.
<p>
<a name="knownTargets pitcl command">
<h2>knownTargets</h2>
</a>
<p>
<b>Usage:</b> knownTargets ?<i>domain</i>?
<p>
Return a list of targets for the specified domain. (if no
domain is given) the current domain.
<p>
<a name="knownUniverses pitcl command">
<h2>knownUniverses</h2>
</a>
<p>
<b>Usage:</b> knownUniverses
<p>
Return a list of the names of the known universes.
Each name begins with a dot, and hence is absolute.
<p>
<a name="mathematica pitcl command">
<h2>mathematica</h2>
</a>
<p>
<b>Usage:</b> mathematica <i>command</i> ?<i>arg</i> ...? 
<p>
Manage a Mathematica session. Mathematica is a commercial program for
symbolic mathematics. This command will only work if your version
of the executable has been built with an interface to Mathematica.
Possible commands and their arguments are given below:
<pre>
  terminate session:             end
  evaluate Mathematica command:  eval<i>script</i>
  get expression in Tcl form:    get<i>name</i>?_script_?
  evaluate Mathematica command:  send<i>script</i>
  start a session:               start ?_identifier_?
  Tcl/Mathematica status:        status
</pre>
 
The "mathematica send" command will not return output generated by
Mathematica (unless an error occurs), "mathematica eval" will return
it as a single string, and "mathematica get" sends the script for
evaluation and returns the value of the variable name.  For example,
"<tcl>mathematica send {Plot[Sin[2 Pi x], {x, 0, 1}]}</tcl>" will
create a simple plot, and "<tcl>mathematica eval {?Plot}</tcl>"
will return help information about the Plot command.
 
The "mathematica status" command returns 0 if the Tcl/Mathematica
connection is open and Mathematica is running, and non-zero
otherwise. A -1 indicates that the connection is not open, whereas 1
means that Mathematica is not running.
 
Note that Mathematica syntax uses square brackets to denote function
calls, parenthesis to group algebraic expressions, and curly braces
to denote vectors and matrices.  If Tcl tries to evaluate a string
containing any of these special characters, then Tcl will flag an error.
<p>
<a name="matlab pitcl command">
<h2>matlab</h2>
</a>
<p>
<b>Usage:</b> matlab <i>command</i> ?<i>arg</i> ...? 
<p>
Manage a Matlab session. This command will only work if your version
of the executable has been built with Matlab. Possible commands and
their arguments are given below:
<pre>
  terminate session:           end
  evaluate Matlab script:      eval<i>script</i>
  get matrix as Tcl lists:     get<i>name</i>?_script_?
  get matrix as ordered pairs: getpairs<i>name</i>?_script_?
  evaluate Matlab script:      send<i>script</i>
  set matrix as Tcl lists:     set<i>name</i>_rows_<i>cols</i>_real_ ?_imag_?
  start a session:             start ?_identifier_? ?_start_command_?
  Tcl/Matlab status:           status
  unset a matrix:              unset
</pre>
 
The "matlab send" command will not return output from by Matlab (unless
an error occurs), "matlab eval" will return output as a single string, and
"matlab get" sends the script for evaluation and returns the value of
the variable name. For example,
"<tcl>::pitcl::matlab send {plot( [1 2 2.5 1] )}</tcl>"
will create a simple plot, and
"<tcl>::pitcl::matlab eval {help plot}</tcl>" will
return help information about the plot command.
<p>
The "matlab status" command returns 0 if the Tcl/Matlab connection is
open and Matlab is running, and non-zero otherwise.  A return value of
-1 indicates that the connection is not open, whereas 1 means that
Matlab is not running.
 
The "matlab start" command will launch an interface to Matlab.  If the
MATLAB_SERVER_HOSTNAME environment variable is set, then Matlab will
be started on that machine.
The <start_command> argument specifies how to start Matlab.
 
Note that Matlab syntax uses square brackets to denote vectors and matrices,
which will cause errors if Tcl tries to evaluate a string containing them.
<p>
NOTE: The matlab command can cause Tycho to hang if it is being run
in the background.  This is because the external interface provided
for matlab assumes that a terminal is connected to the program.  To
unhang tycho, put it in the foreground.  We have also sometimes seen
matlab hang the entire X window session.  To correct this, kill the
matlab process.  Bugs should be reported to the Math Works, Inc.

<a name="monitor pitcl command">
<h2>monitor</h2>
</a>
<p>
<b>Usage:</b> monitor on|off
<p>
Turn on or off the monitoring of ptcl commands.  When monitoring is on,
then every time a ptcl command is called, the full text of the command
is passed to the "monitorPtcl" procedure.  By default, that procedure
prints out the command using the Tcl puts procedure, but that procedure
may be overridden.
<p>
<a name="monitorPtcl pitcl command">
<h2>monitorPtcl</h2>
</a>
When monitoring is turned on, this procedure is called each time a Ptcl
procedure is invoked.  The full text of the command is passed as arguments.
This method may be overridden, but the default method prints the command
using the Tcl puts procedure.
<p>
FIXME: This does not work for defGalaxy commands.
<p>
<a name="onFiring pitcl command">
<h2>onFiring</h2>
</a>
<p>
<b>Usage:</b> onFiring ?-before? ?-after? ?<i>starname</i>? <i>command</i>
<p>
Bind a Tcl command to the firing of a star.  If the -after option
is given, then the binding triggers after the star firing (the invocation
of its <code>run</code> method, which invokes the <code>go</code> method).
If the -before option is given, or if no options are given, then
the binding triggers before the firing.
If no starname is specified, then the command is bound to all star
firings.  In either case, the full name of the particular star that
triggers the binding will be appended to the command before the command
invoked. For example, the command
<pre>
	onFiring puts
</pre>
will result in the printing of the name of every star after it is fired.
The value returned by registerAction is a handle (a unique string)
that can be used to cancel the action using <code>onFiringCancel</code>.
<p>
<a name="onFiringCancel pitcl command">
<h2>onFiringCancel</h2>
</a>
<p>
<b>Usage:</b> onFiringCancel <i>handle</i>|all
<p>
Cancel a binding created with <code>onFiring</code>.
The single argument is the handle returned by <code>onFiring</code> or the keyword
"all", in which case the all existing bindings are canceled.
<p>
<a name="ports pitcl command">
<h2>ports</h2>
</a>
Return a list of port names for the specified block.
<p>
<b>Usage:</b> ports ?-inputs? ?-outputs? ?-multiports? <i>blockname</i>
<p>
If options are specified, they can be any combination of:
<ul>
<li> -inputs
<li> -outputs
<li> -multiports
</ul>
The first two options indicate that inputs or outputs should be
listed. Specifying both of these options lists only ports that are
both an input and an output, something supported in some domains.
Specifying neither results in all ports being listed.
The -multiports option specifies that only multiports should be
listed, rather than the individual ports within the multiport.
In this case, after each multiport is a list of its contained ports.
For example, a multiport named "input" with two contained ordinary
ports will appear in the result as "input {input#1 input#2}".
<p>
<a name="portsContained pitcl command">
<h2>portsContained</h2>
</a>
<p>
<b>Usage:</b> portsContained ?-deep? <i>portname</i>
<p>
Return a list of ports contained by the given multiport. If the
-deep option is given, then return the lowest level ports in the alias
chain, which are always star ports.  Otherwise, the returned ports
may be galaxy ports.  It is an error if the named port is not a multiport.
<p>
<a name="remove pitcl command">
<h2>remove</h2>
</a>
<p>
<b>Usage:</b> remove <i>name</i>
<p>
Delete the specified block.
<p>
<a name="reset pitcl command">
<h2>reset</h2>
</a>
<p>
<b>Usage:</b> reset ?<i>galname</i>?
<p>
Reconstruct the specified galaxy, or if none is specified, the current
galaxy.  This deletes all contained blocks, and then
constructs new blocks of the same time and redoes all the connections.
It uses the actionList of InterpGalaxy.
<p>
FIXME: test
<p>
<a name="run pitcl command">
<h2>run</h2>
</a>
<p>
<b>Usage:</b> run <i>univname</i> ?<i>stoptime</i>?
<p>
Run a universe until the specified stop time.  What this time means
depends on the domain.  In SDF, for example, it gives the number of
iterations of a complete schedule.  In DE, it gives the simulated time
after which no more events will be processed.  If no argument is given,
then the stop time is taken to be unity.  As a side effect, the current
galaxy is set to the universe being run.  This procedure is equivalent
to the sequence <code>init</code>, <code>begin</code>, <code>cont</code>.
<p>
<a name="setState pitcl command">
<h2>setState</h2>
</a>
<p>
<b>Usage:</b> setState <i>statename</i> <i>statevalue</i>
<p>
Set the initial value of the specified state.  For this to affect the
current value you must invoke <code>initState</code>.
<p>
<a name="setTarget pitcl command">
<h2>setTarget</h2>
</a>
<p>
<b>Usage:</b> setTarget ?<i>blockname</i>? <i>targetname</i>
<p>
Change the target for the specified block. Currently, the block must
be a universe, although eventually it may be allowed to be a
wormhole. If no block is specified, assume the current galaxy (which
again must be a universe).  The targets for the all the constituent
blocks are immediately updated (no need to initialize).
<p>
<a name="states pitcl command">
<h2>states</h2>
</a>
<p>
<b>Usage:</b> states ?<i>blockname</i>?
<p>
Return the list of states in the given block. If no argument is
given, return a list of the states of the current galaxy.
<p>
<a name="stateValue pitcl command">
<h2>stateValue</h2>
</a>
<p>
<b>Usage:</b> stateValue ?-initial? <i>statename</i>
<p>
Return the value of the specified state. If the option is -initial,
then return the initial value. Otherwise, return the current value.
<p>
<a name="wrapup pitcl command">
<h2>wrapup</h2>
</a>
<p>
<b>Usage:</b> wrapup <i>univname</i>
<p>
Invoke the wrapup method of the specified universe.
