<h1><a name="Pcl editor">User's Guide to the Ptcl Editor</a></h1>

<p> This class provides a text editor specialized for editing Ptcl
source.  Ptcl is the Ptolemy extension to Tcl.  It is automatically
invoked whenever you open any file with an <a name=".ptcl">".ptcl"
extension</a> or <a name=".pt">".pt" extension</a> or if a directory is
opened and it contains a <CODE>schematic/contents;</CODE> subfile,
and the directory is not named <CODE>*.pal</CODE>.

<P> Ptolemy is a software environment that provides simulation an code
generation capabilities.  <A
HREF="http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu">http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu</A>
describes the Ptolemy project in detail.
The <a name="EditPtcl class">EditPtcl class</a> is derived from the
<a href="EditItclHelp.html">EditItcl class</a>, and
therefore inherits all of its features.
It colors certain Ptcl constructs, such as comments
and universe definitions.

<P>To evaluate a ptcl file, you must have the ptcl extensions built
into the binary that tycho is running.  To start tycho with the ptcl
extension, run <CODE>tycho -pigi</CODE>.  See <A
HREF="../../../../doc/running.html">the Tycho startup
documentation</A> for more information.

<p>
The Ptcl editor has a <CODE>Special</CODE> menubutton, which has the 
following choices:
<MENU>
<LI> Retarget - Brings up the <A HREF="../../../../typt/editors/doc/usersGuides/RetargetHelp.html">Retargetting</A> editor, which can be used to 
retarget a Ptolemy universe between domains.

<LI> List Stars - List the names of the stars used by the ptcl file.

<LI> Ptolemy Universes - Bring up a browser that shows all the Ptolemy
universes in the Ptolemy tree.

<LI> Universe Name - Show the name of the universe defined by this file.

</MENU>
