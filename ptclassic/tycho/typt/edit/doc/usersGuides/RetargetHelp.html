<p>

This class provides a graphical editor that can be used to retarget
Ptolemy universes.  The retargetting editor is invoked from a menu
choice under the "Special" menu of the ptcl editor.  The ptcl editor
is started up if you edit a file with the <CODE>.pt</CODE>
or <CODE>.ptcl</CODE> extension.

<P> Ptolemy is a software environment that provides simulation an code
generation capabilities.  <A
HREF="http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu">http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu</A>
describes the Ptolemy project in detail, but briefly, a Ptolemy
program is called a <I>Universe</I> which consists of multiple
functional blocks, (such as adders etc.) named <I>Stars</I>.
Different models of computation are called Ptolemy <I>Domains</I>.
This editor is used to retarget Universes between different domains.
For example, there is the CG56 domain that generates code for the
Motorola 56k processor and there is a domain for the Texas Instruments
C50 domain.  This editor can be used to retarget a universe that was
written in the CG56 domain to the C50 domain.  The retargetting editor
can also be used to compare the stars in two different domains.

<li> Currently, while the tool is comparing domains, no status messages
come up until after the compare is done. Perhaps we need an update or a
flush here.

<li> If the user opens the retargetting editor from a ptcl editor, we should
probably change domainA to the domain of the universe in the ptcl editor.

<li> The buttons that change domainA and domainB should be menus with radio
button choices of all the domains.  Also, the buttons don't get updated
with the name of the new domain choice.

<li> If the user is attempting to retarget a multi domain universe,
then things could get a little confusing. Currently, the tool throws
away the domain information of the stars in the ptcl file and just
compares star names.
