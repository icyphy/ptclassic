<p>

This class provides a graphical editor that can be used to retarget
Ptolemy universes.  The retargetting editor is invoked from a menu
choice under the "Special" menu of the ptcl editor.  The ptcl editor
is started up if you edit a file with the <CODE>.pt</CODE>
or <CODE>.ptcl</CODE> extension.

<P> Ptolemy is a software environment that provides simulation an code
generation capabilities.  <A
HREF="http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu">http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu</A>
describes the Ptolemy project in detail, but briefly, a Ptolemy
program is called a <I>Universe</I> which consists of multiple
functional blocks, (such as adders etc.) named <I>Stars</I>.
Different models of computation are called Ptolemy <I>Domains</I>.
This editor is used to retarget Universes between different domains.
For example, there is the CG56 domain that generates code for the
Motorola 56k processor and there is a domain for the Texas Instruments
C50 domain.  This editor can be used to retarget a universe that was
written in the CG56 domain to the C50 domain.  The retargetting editor
can also be used to compare the stars in two different domains.
