<h1><a name="Ptolemy Retargeting editor">User's Guide to the Ptolemy
Retargeting Editor</a></h1>

<p>

This class provides a graphical editor that can be used to retarget
Ptolemy universes.  To use this editor, you must be running a binary that 
has Ptolemy built in.  To start Tycho with Ptolemy, see
<A HREF="../../../../doc/tyunix.html#Ptolemy with Tycho">Executing Tycho with Ptolemy</A>
in the Tycho under Unix guide.

<P> Ptolemy is a software environment that provides simulation an code
generation capabilities.  <A
HREF="http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu">http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu</A>
describes the Ptolemy project in detail, but briefly, a Ptolemy
program is called a <I>Universe</I> which consists of multiple
functional blocks, (such as adders etc.) named <I>Stars</I>.
Different models of computation are called Ptolemy <I>Domains</I>.
This editor is used to retarget Universes between different domains.
For example, there is the CG56 domain that generates code for the
Motorola 56k processor and there is a domain for the Texas Instruments
C50 domain.  This editor can be used to retarget a universe that was
written in the CG56 domain to the C50 domain.  The retargeting editor
can also be used to compare the stars in two different domains.

The Retargeting editor can be started up from a <A HREF="EditPtclHelp.html">ptcl editor</A>.

The <CODE>Special</CODE> menu button in the ptcl editor contains the
<CODE>Retarget</CODE> menu choice which brings up the retargeting editor.

<H3>Retargeting Buttons</H3>
<MENU>

<LI> <CODE>Compare Domains</CODE> - This button compares the stars in
the two current domains and displays the different categories of
conflict.

<LI> <CODE>Change Domain A <I>Domain</I></CODE> - This button brings
up a ListBrowser that allow the user to change the domain.  Usually
Domain A is the domain we are retargeting from.  If the retargeting
editor was started from a Ptcl editor, then Domain A defaults to the
domain of the Universe.  Only the domains that are present in the
currently running binary are listed.

<LI> <CODE>Change Domain B <I>Domain</I></CODE> - This button brings
up a ListBrowser that allows the user to change the domain.
Usually Domain B is the domain we are retargeting to.

<LI> <CODE>Check Universe</CODE> - This button asks the ptcl editor
for a list of all the stars in it and then checks the stars against
the different types of conflicts.

</MENU>

The bottom of the retargeting window contains a serious of counters
that display the number of stars in the different categories.  If you
move the mouse over these counters, then the status window should
provide a brief description of the counter.

<H3>A short example</H3>

<OL>
<LI> Start up <CODE>tycho -pigi</CODE>.  The <CODE>-pigi</CODE> option
means that tycho uses a binary that knows about the Ptolemy stars.

<LI> Open the file
<A HREF="$PTOLEMY/tycho/typt/lib/PtolemyFacets.fst"><CODE>$PTOLEMY/tycho/typt/lib/PtolemyFacets.fst</CODE></A>.
<CODE>PtolemyFacets.fst</CODE> contains a forest that describes all
the different universes in the Ptolemy tree.  A graphical window that
displays the forest should come up.

<LI> Scroll the forest window until the <A
HREF="$PTOLEMY/src/domains/cgc/demo/sound"><CODE>$PTOLEMY/src/domains/cgc/demo/sound</CODE></A>
node is visible and then double click on the node. A graphical editor
that lists the stars in the sound universe will come up.

<LI> Under the <CODE>Special</CODE>menu button of the sound Palette, select
<CODE>Show Ptcl</CODE>. A ptcl editor
window should come up that contains a textual description of the
<I>sound</I> universe.

<LI>  Under the <CODE>Special</CODE> menu button in the ptcl editor, select
the <CODE>Retarget</CODE> choice and the retarget editor should come up.

<LI> In the Retargeting editor, hit the <CODE>Change Domain B</CODE>
button and change the domain to C50.  We are going to attempt to
retarget the domain from CGC to the Texas Instruments C50 domain.

<LI> In the Retargeting editor, mouse on the <CODE>Check Universe</CODE>
button.  After a brief wait, the Retargeting editor will display the
names of the stars in sound demo, and the conflicts between the CGC and the
C50 domain.  You can double click on a star name which will bring up a window
that compares the two stars in the different domains.

<LI> To compare all the stars in the CGC and C50 domains, mouse on the 
<CODE>Compare Domains</CODE> button.
</OL>



<h2><a name="Ptolemy Retargeting editor bugs">Ptolemy Retargeting
editor bugs</a></h2>

<menu>

<li> Currently, while the tool is comparing domains, no status messages
come up until after the compare is done. Perhaps we need an update or a
flush here.

<li> If the user is attempting to retarget a multi domain universe,
then things could get a little confusing. Currently, the tool throws
away the domain information of the stars in the ptcl file and just
compares star names.

<li> There is no easy way to call the Retargeting editor from within
Ptolemy.  The problem is that if Ptolemy is present, and you open a
facet from within Tycho, then the facet is passed to vem.  What we
need is some easy way to convert a facet to ptcl.
