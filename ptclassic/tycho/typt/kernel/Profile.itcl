# Global variables

# the global variable ptolemy is assumed to point to the home directory
# of the Ptolemy installation

# used to collect profile information before displaying:
if ![info exists ptkProfileString] {
    set ptkProfileString ""
}

#### ptkDisplayProfile
# Display the contents of the global string ptkDisplayProfile.
# This is backward compatible with the profile command in pigi.
# NOTE: This should be replaced with something that uses HTML
# and has hyperlinks to the full documentation and the source code.
