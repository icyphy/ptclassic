<h1>Pakman -- A Tcl package support package</h1>

 <P>Pakman is a utility that assists in creating and managing
Tcl packages. A new package can be created from a
"template" package, and various other options perform
functions such as mirroring the package, creating
distributions, and installing the package in a new
location.

<p>The current version of Pakman supports only
Tcl script packages. A later version may offer support for
binary extension packages.

 <P>The facilities of Pakman are usually accessed through the
<B>pakman</B> shell command, which has this calling syntax:

 <P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>pakman</B> <I>subcommand</I> <I>arguments</I> <I>options</I>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

 <P>The <I>subcommand</I> selects one of the operations provided by
the package. <I>arguments</I> are arguments requires by that
subcommand, such as a package name or file names, and <I>options</I>
are command-line options that control the way that the subcommand
executes.


 <P>The following command-line options are accepted by all
subcommands:


<dl style="margin-left: 2em">
<dt>
<b>-d
<br>-debug</b>

<dd>
Print debugging information.

<dt>
<b>-s
<br>-silent</b>

<dd>Print no information at all.

</dl>


 <P>The subcommands and corresponding arguments are as follows.

<dl>
<dt><B>pakman create</B> <I>pkgname</I> <I>version</I> <I>options</I>

<dd>Create a new package named <I>pkgname</I>. By default, a new
directory will be created for the package in the current directory.
By default, the directory name will the text in the package name
following the last period, converted to lower-case. To override the
default, specify the <B>-path</B> option.

 <P>The directory will be created if it does not exist, and then the
structure of the template directory mirrored in the new package
directory.  See the <b>-style</b> and <b>-template</b> options for how
this directory is chosen. Each file in the template directories that
starts with a <B>_</B> (an underscore) is copied into the new package
with some text substitutions performed on it. For example, the file
<B>templates/doc/_index.html</B> will be instantiated as the file
<B><I>pkgname</I>/doc/index.html</B>.  Within these file names, any
occurence of a <B>#</B> (hash symbol) has the trailing part of the
package name (after the last period) substituted.  If a file already
exists, then the file will not be overwritten.  The directory
structure of the template directory will be traversed, except for
directories named SCCS, RCS, or CVS.


 <P>Each copied file has the following substitutions performed:

<dl>
<dt><B>%PACKAGE%</B>
<dd>The package name, in upper-case.

<dt><B>%Package%</B>
<dd>The package name, as given to this subcommand.

<dt><B>%package%</B>
<dd>The package name, in lower-case.

<dt><B>%PKG%</B>
<dd>The package name tail, in upper-case. The "tail" of a package
name is all text following the last period in the package name.

<dt><B>%Pkg%</B>
<dd>The package name tail, as given to this subcommand.

<dt><B>%pkg%</B>
<dd>The package name tail, in lower-case.

<dt><B>%version%</B>
<dd>The package version.

<dt><B>%copyright%</B>

<dd>The copyright string. This is the text contained in a file called
"copyright" in the top-level template directory. The copyright string
will have further substitutions performed on it.

</dl>

 <P>
The following options are accepted. 

<dl>
<dt>
<b>-p</b> <I>path</I>
<br><b>-path</b> <I>path</I>

<dd>Use the given path as the path to the package. The
path can be relative or absolute. The path must end with the
directory in which the package will be created.

<dt><B>-sccs</B> <I>script</I>

<dd>If <I>script</I> is <B>0</B>, then don't create SCCS
directories. Otherwise, create an SCCS directory in the package
directory and each sub-directory, run the script if it isn't the empty
string, and then <B>sccs create</B> each new file.

<dt><B>-style</B> <I>stylename</I>

<dd>Choose the "style" of package. If this option is given,
<b>pakman</b> expects to find a directory named
<b>template.</b><i>style</i> in the current directory, or in the
<b>pakman</b> installation directory. If it finds one then it uses
it. If the option is not given, then it tried to use a directory
called <b>template</b> in the same two paths; otherwise, it uses
<b>template.simple</b>.

<dt><B>-template</B> <I>path</I>

<dd>Use this directory as the directory containing template files,
instead of the directory chosen by the <b>-style</b> option.

<dt><B>-version</B> <I>version</I>

<dd>Give the package this version, instead of
the default, which is <B>1.0</B>.

<dt><B>-</b><i>option</i> <I>value</I>

<dd>Any other option is interpreted as a value to
be substituted in to the template files. The value
of the option given as <B>-</b><i>option</i> will
be substituted for every occurrence of the string
<b>%</b><i>option</i><b>%</b>. Typical options
supplied are <b>-author</b>.

</dl>


<dt><B>pakman mirror</B> <I>pkgpath</I> <I>mirror</I> <I>options</I>

<dd>Make a "mirror" of a package in another directory. This is
intended for use in development environments with a shared development
tree, in which certain directories should not be copied into the
developer's "mirror" directory, but have a symbolic link
created instead.

 <P>The <I>pkgpath</I> is the path to the package in the master
development tree, and <I>mirror</I> is the path to the directory in
the local tree. <I>mirror</I> can be absolute or relative.  By
default, this command duplicates the structure of the development
tree, making symbolic links to each subdirectory that does not contain
a subdirectory CVS, RCS or SCCS. If the <B>-command</B> option is
supplied, then this is executed in each directory. Otherwise, after
completion, the shell command <B>make sources</B> is executed in the
mirror directory -- if a makefile structure is set up, then this will
load the directories properly.

 <P>If the given <I>pkgpath</I> already exists, then the tree will
still be scanned, and new directories created only if directories do
not already exist.

 <P>
The following options are accepted. 

<dl>
<dt><B>-command</B> <I>script</I>

<dd>Run <I>script</I> in each directory, after creating the symbolic
links. This is useful if <B>make sources</B> in the top-level tree
does not do the right thing.

<dt><B>-exclude</B> <I>dirlist</I>

<dd>Exclude the listed directories from the mirrored directories, even
if they have an SCCS or RCS directory. If there is more than one
directory they must be enclosed in curly braces: <b>"</b>dir1
dir2<b>"</b>.

<dt><B>-include</B> <I>dir ...</I>

<dd>Include the listed directories in the mirrored directories, even
if they don't have an SCCS or RCS directory. If they don't have an
SCCS or RCS directory, then any files that look like a makefile will
just be copied into the directory.  If there is more than one
directory they must be enclosed in quotes: <b>"</b>dir1
dir2<b>"</b>.

</dl>

<dt><B>pakman version</B> <I>pkgpath</I> ?<I>version</I>?

<dd>If the version name is not supplied, then return the version
indicated by the <B>pkgIndex.tcl</B> file in the package named
<I>pkgpath</I>. If <I>version</I> is supplied, modify the
<B>pkgIndex.tcl</B> and <B><I>package</I>.tcl</B> files in that
directory to be the new version.

 <P> <I>pkgpath</I> can be relative or absolute. If no such directory
is found, then lower-case the last segment of <I>pkgpath</I> and try
again.

<dt><B>pakman sccs</B> <I>path </I><i>options</i>

<dd> Traverse the directory given by <I>path</I> and place files under
SCCS control. This is useful when a developer has been working on
files in a local tree, and, having copied the subtree into the
shared development tree, wishes to check all of the files in.

 <P>
The following options are accepted. 

<dl>
<dt><B>-command</B> <I>script</I>

<dd>Run <I>script</I> in each directory. This is run after creating
the SCCS directory, but before checking in files.  This may be needed
to changed the permissions of files or the version control
directory. For example, in our tree, we would call this command as:

 <p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>pakman</B> <B>sccs</B> <B>-command</B> <B>"exec chgrp ptolemy SCCS"</B>
</BLOCKQUOTE>


<dt><B>-exclude</B> <I>dirlist</I>

<dd>Exclude the listed directories from the traversed directories.
The default is <B>img</B>. Note that directories named
SCCS and RCS are always excluded. If there is more than one
directory they must be enclosed in curly braces: <b>{</b>dir1
dir2<b>}</b>.

</dl>


</dl>


<h2>Future subcommands</h2>

The following subcommands are planned for a future
version of <b>pakman</b>.

<dl>

<dt><B>pakman distribute</B> <I>pkgpath</I> <i>options</i>

<dd>Create a distribution of the package. The package is
cleaned and then zipped and tarred into various distribution
files. 

<dt><B>pakman install</B> <I>source</I> <i>target</i> <i>options</i>

<dd>Install a distribution of the package. The <i>source</i>
can either be a zip or compressed tar file, or an unpacked
directory.

</dl>


<h2>Calling from Tcl</h2>

 <P>The functionality of Pakman can be accessed from other Tcl
scripts by executing a <B>package require Pakman</B> and then
calling the <B>pakman</B> procedure. The arguments to this
procedure are exactly the same as to the <B>pakman</B> shell script.

 <P>The subcommands can also be called directly from Tcl.  For
example, the <I>create</I> sub-command is accessible as the
<B>::pakman::create</B> procedure. The arguments to these
procedures are the same as to <B>pakman</B>, except that
command-line options that are shown as a single flag must have a
boolean value supplied. For example,

<pre>
    pakman create MyPackage -debug
</pre>

would be called as

<pre>
    ::pakman::create MyPackage -debug 1
</pre>
