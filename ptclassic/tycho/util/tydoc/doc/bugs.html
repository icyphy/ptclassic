	<LI> If we have a series of declarations that are not
	separated by blank lines, should they all share the same
	doc comment?  Usually, in the code, we have a comment, then
	a bunch of declarations.  Currently tydoc dumps the first 
	declaration, and then the comment, and then the other declarations. 

	<LI> The arguments to <CODE>option</CODE> are not
	handled properly.  We currently print:
	<LISTING>
	option add {*RevControlSCCS.versionColor}
	</LISTING>
	Instead of:
	<LISTING>
	option add *RevControlSCCS.versionColor [ptkColor blue black] widgetDefault
	</LISTING>

	<LI> Links that work from the kernel directory do not
	necessarily work from the doc/codeDoc directory.
	<CODE>ListBrowser.itcl</CODE> has such a link.

	
	<LI> If you run <CODE>tydoc</CODE> on the iwidgets classes, then
	the output does not look as good as it could.  This is in part
	because the iwidgets classes don't have tydoc sensitive doctags.


	<LI> Iwidgets2.1.0/combobox.itcl has a line like:
	<PRE>
    private   variable _currItem {};           ;# current selected item.
	</PRE>
	which produces the message: <CODE> Failed to call classClause:
	list element in braces followed by ";" instead of space </CODE>
	The problem is the trailing <CODE>;</CODE> in <CODE>{};</CODE>


	<LI> Not all of the iwidgets classes are consistent in their
	use of namespaces.  For instance, <CODE>hyperhelp.itk</CODE>
	declares a class as:
	<PRE>
	class ::iwidgets::Hyperhelp {
	[...]
	    itk_option define -topics topics Topics {}
	[...]
	}
	</PRE>
	but then the configbody of <CODE>topics</CODE> does not
	have a leading <CODE>::</CODE>:
	<PRE>
	configbody iwidgets::Hyperhelp::topics {
	</PRE>
	<CODE>menubar.itk</CODE> has a similar problem with
	 <CODE>_getCallerLevel</CODE>.

	<LI> Tydoc is slow.  
	<LI> It would be nice if the tydoc script would not needlessly
	generate new html files for data that has not changed.  However,
	to do this we need to be able to map what classes are defined
	in what files, and check the mod times of the source files
	against the html files.

	<LI> The version info should be parsed, if it is recognized as SCCS.

	<LI> There should be a link to the actual source code.
