<MENU>

	<LI> If we have a series of declarations that are not
	separated by blank lines, should they all share the same
	doc comment?  Usually, in the code, we have a comment, then
	a bunch of declarations.  Currently tydoc dumps the first 
	declaration, and then the comment, and then the other declarations. 

	<LI> The arguments to <CODE>option</CODE> are not
	handled properly.  We currently print:
	<LISTING>
	option add {*RevControlSCCS.versionColor}
	</LISTING>
	Instead of:
	<LISTING>
	option add *RevControlSCCS.versionColor [ptkColor blue black] widgetDefault
	</LISTING>

	<LI> If we have a destructor that looks like:
	<LISTING>
	    destructor {
		unset instances($this)
	    }
	</LISTING>
	Then we incorrectly assume that <CODE>unset . . .</CODE>
	is the args.

	<LI> Links that work from the kernel directory do not
	necessarily work from the doc/codeDoc directory.
	<CODE>ListBrowser.itcl</CODE> has such a link.

	<LI> Tydoc is slow.  
	<LI> It would be nice if the tydoc script would not needlessly
	generate new html files for data that has not changed.  However,
	to do this we need to be able to map what classes are defined
	in what files, and check the mod times of the source files
	against the html files.

	<LI> The version info should be parsed, if it is recognized as SCCS.
