	<LI> If we have a series of declarations that are not
	separated by blank lines, should they all share the same
	doc comment?


	<LI> The arguments to <CODE>itk_option</CODE> are not
	handled properly.  We currently print:
	<LISTING>
	itk_option define {-master} 
	</LISTING>
	Instead of:
	<LISTING>
	itk_option define -master master Master "0"
	</LISTING>

	<LI> Tydoc is slow.  
	<LI> It would be nice if the tydoc script would not needlessly
	generate new html files for data that has not changed.  However,
	to do this we need to be able to map what classes are defined
	in what files, and check the mod times of the source files
	against the html files.
