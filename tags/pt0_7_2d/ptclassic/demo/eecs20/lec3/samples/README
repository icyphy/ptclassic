For EECS20 Demos, start the Sun audiotool application,
and play the following files:
	sorrydave.au
	decimated_2.au
	decimated_4.au
	dec_interp_2.au
	dec_interp_4.au
The audiofiles (.au extension) in this directory can be played using
the Sun audiotool application.

The files are created using the Ptolemy systems in lec3.
Regrettably, these applications create files in raw format (.raw extension).
One extremely primitive program that can convert them is
/usr/demo/SOUND/bin/soundtool.
