Dynamic Map Function for the Discrete Event Domain</H1>

<P>
<HR WIDTH="100%"><A NAME="introduction"></A>In Ptolemy 0.7 and earlier
the DE domain did not support a mutable system configuration. The map function
in Ptolemy's&nbsp; HOF domain allows for instantiating as many objects
of a block as one needs. But, all these objects will be in the system configuration
for the entire simulation's runtime. Moreover, one has to specify the number
of objects before the simulation starts. So, the common map function does
not support a mutable system configuration.

<P>In the following, a group of stars which implement a dynamic map function
is introduced. These stars look form the outside pretty much like the common
map stars in the HOF domain. However, the <TT>DEDynMap</TT> star does not
have a parameter for the number of multiplications - as it is the buswidth
in the HOF domain -, but two additional inputs. These inputs expect events
when a new copy of a block is to be put into the topology or is to be taken
out of it. So, these stars allow for instantiation and deletion of any
block during runtime on demand. Hence, they give the chance to change the
topology during the runtime of a simulation.

<P>In the contrary to Ptolemy's HOF stars, these stars have heavily to
work and to interact with the scheduler. So, they are only implemented
for the DE-domain.

<P>All icons for the stars which are explained below are in a palette <TT>mutable.pal</TT>,
which can be found in <TT>$PTOLEMY/src/domains/de/contrib/demo</TT>.

<P>
<HR WIDTH="100%">
<BR><A NAME="using"></A>The <TT>DEDynMap </TT>star and derived types allow
for runtime creation and deletion on demand of any block (star, galaxy,
source, sink) in the DE domain. The block, which is to be multiplied at
runtime, is in the following called the <I>master block</I>. It is the
equivalent of the <I>replacement block</I> in the HOF domain. The <I>master
block</I> can itself contain dynamic map functions, thus allowing cascaded
mutations.

<P>The <TT>DEDynMap</TT> star is always to be used together with <TT>DEDynMerge</TT>
and/or <TT>DEDynFork</TT> stars in order to adapt the number of portholes
and connections automatically during runtime. The <I>master block</I> itself
is to be specified textually in the parameters of the <TT>DEDynMap star</TT>.
Alternatively, a graphical version <TT>DEDynMapGr</TT> is also provided.

<P>The <TT>DEDynMap</TT> star creates or deletes instances of the <I>master
block</I> and connects their portholes to the multiportholes in <TT>DEDynFork
</TT>and <TT>DEDynMerge</TT>. So, these stars separate the runtime mutations
from their outside: All mutations take place between the <TT>DEDynFork
</TT>and the <TT>DEDynMerge</TT> stars. The <TT>DEDynMap</TT> star creates
a new copy of the <I>master block</I> and puts it into the topology each
time it gets fired at the <I>newBlock</I> porthole. It takes a copy out
of the topology and deletes it each time it gets fired at the <I>delBlock</I>
porthole. The copies are identified by an<I> instancenumber</I>. These
stars perform everything needed to mutate the topology, like changing the
number of portholes in <TT>DEDynMerge</TT> and <TT>DEDynFork</TT> or setting
up new connections. The user does not need to program anything. These stars
can be used in Ptolemy schematics in the common way: they just are to be
connected with other stars and their states are to be set.
