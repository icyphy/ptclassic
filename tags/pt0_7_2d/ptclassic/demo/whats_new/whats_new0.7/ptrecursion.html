<H1>Checks for Recursive and Duplicate Galaxy Definitions</H1>

Several new checks for errors and possible errors have been added.

<MENU>
<LI>
Ptolemy will now detect a recursive galaxy definition and issue an error
message, rather than thrashing and eventually coredumping as it used to.
This is implemented by a test for recursive invocation of KnownBlock::clone
or KnownBlock::makeNew; therefore it will trigger when the recursive
definition is used, not when it is made.  An error report is produced with
Error::abortRun, and NULL is returned as though the block didn't exist.
The NULL return tends to lead to additional, extraneous error messages
afterwards, but it beats the heck out of the previous behavior when you've
accidentally created a self-referential galaxy.

<LI>
KnownBlock keeps track of the definition source of each known block,
and issues warning messages (<em>not</em> fatal errors) if it changes.
The conditions detected by this test are:
<UL>
<LI> Multiple built-in definitions of the same block name/domain;
<LI> Star definition replaced by galaxy definition or vice versa;
<LI> Oct-facet galaxy replaced by one originating from a different Oct
facet (ie, duplicate facet names);
<LI> Oct-facet galaxy replaced by a ptcl defgalaxy or vice versa.
</UL>
Previously, the system would just silently use the new definition of
the block type, which could lead to quite mystifying behavior in a
schematic "that was working a moment ago".  It is hoped that the warning
message will reduce confusion.  (A better solution would be to name
block types using more than just the last component of their path names.
The warning should be viewed as a stopgap measure until we are prepared
to break backwards compatibility in that fashion.)
<P>
Some of the Ptolemy demos use identically named subgalaxies, which
means that this warning will trigger here and there if you run all
the demos in sequence.  Just click "OK" to continue.
