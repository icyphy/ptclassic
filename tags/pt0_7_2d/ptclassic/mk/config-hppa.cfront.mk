# HPPA CC notes
# 1) If you purchase just the C++ compiler, you do _not_ get a C
#    compiler automatically.  You have to purchase the C compiler
#    separately.  You might be able to compile Ptolemy by using
#    HP CC and gcc, there are a few lines below that would need to be 
#    changed, see the comments.
# 2) To see what version of CC you are running, type 'what /usr/bin/CC'
# 3) You should probably install the latest and greatest CC and ld
#    patches off of the hp patch site.  As of 2/96, the site was
#    http://us-support.external.hp.com/
#    In a vanilla HPUX-10.20 installation, we installed
#	PHSS_9855 - s700_800 10.X HP C++ (A.10.24) with a correct eh/lib++.a
#	PHSS_9400 - s700_800 10.20 ld(1) cumulative patch
#	PHSS_9927 - s700_800 10.X ANSI C compiler cumulative patch
#	PHKL_8693 - s700 10.20 sys/time.h fix for select(2)/C++ defects

# MEMLOG    - Formerly used to log memory allocation and deallocation.
# WARNINGS  - Flags that print warnings.
# ARCHFLAGS - Architecture dependent flags, useful for determining which
#	      OS we are on.  Often of the form -DPTSOL2_4.
# LOCALCCFLAGS - Other architecture dependent flags that apply to all releases
#	      of the OS for this architecture for c++
