# common.mk looks at this variable to decide how to build shared libraries

# Note: If you are using gas-2.5.2 (which you must do if you want to
# debug C++ code by using stabs debug format) you CANNOT use shared
# libraries (gas does NOT support -fPIC).  If you want to use shared libraries
# then make sure you are not using gas (in my case I'd move /tools/gccs/bin/as 
# to /tools/gccs/bin/gas) and compile with OPTIMIZER=-O (or anything else, 
# just NO -g) So at the top level you'd do:
# make clean
# make OPTIMIZER=-O USE_SHARED_LIBS=yes install

# In config-$PTARCH.mk, we set the following variables.  We need to

# for non-optimized compiles.
# OPTIMIZER - The setting for the optimizer, usually -O2.
# MEMLOG    - Formerly used to log memory allocation and deallocation.
# WARNINGS  - Flags that print warnings.
# ARCHFLAGS - Architecture dependent flags, useful for determining which
#	      OS we are on.  Often of the form -DPTSOL2_4.

#	      of the OS for this architecture for c++
# LOCALCFLAGS - Other architecture dependent flags that apply to all releases
#	      of the OS for this architecture for c++
# USERFLAGS - Ptolemy makefiles should never set this, but the user can set it.
