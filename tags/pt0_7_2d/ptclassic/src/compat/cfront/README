@(#)README	1.1 11/12/91

The header files in this directory are an attempt to make the
environment under a different compiler (e.g. Sun C++ 2.1)
look like a tiny subset of the libg++ library.  The random
number generator classes duplicate only enough of the behavior
to work under Ptolemy (for example, there is only one stream
of random numbers).
