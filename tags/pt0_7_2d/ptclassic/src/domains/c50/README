README file for ptolemy/src/domains/c50

The Ptolemy c50 domain generates code for the Texas Instruments
TMS320C50 fixed-point DSP processor.  To make much use of this domain,
you will need a PC with a C50.

The c50 domain is based on an initial implementation by Andreas
Baensch and Prof. Fritz Heinrichmeyer at FernUniverstitat in Hagen,
Germany.

Luis Gutierrez and Brian Evans have fleshed out the c50 domain star
library.

Christopher Hylands packaged the tar overlay and patch.

Installation
------------
In August of 1996, the c50 domain was released as a tar file overlay for
Ptolemy0.6.

1) Untar the tar overlay
	To install this tar file, untar it inside your Ptolemy distribution:
		cd $PTOLEMY/..
		gunzip /tmp/pt-0.6.c50.src.tar.gz
		tar -xf /tmp/pt-0.6.c50.src.tar

2) Patch the 0.6 tree.
	Window and RaisedCosine star in c50/dsp/stars need the ptdsp
	library, located in $PTOLEMY/src/utils/libptdsp.  This library
	is not part of the Ptolemy0.6 release, but is included with
	this tar overlay.

	The following files need to be modified to use the c50 domain:

$PTOLEMY/MAKEARCH		- Add c50 to EXPDOMAINS, and to EXPEXTRAS.
				Add libptdsp to the utils section.

$PTOLEMY/mk/ptbin.mk		- Add 'C50 = 1' to the FULL section so that
				the c50 domain is in a full pigiRpc.

$PTOLEMY/mk/stars/mk		- Add the c50 domain in several places.

$PTOLEMY/src/domains/makefile 	- Add the c50 domain to EXPDOMAINS.

$PTOLEMY/src/utils/makefile 	- Add libptdsp to DIRS.

$PTOLEMY/src/domains/c50/kernel/{C50Target,TITarget}.{h,cc} -
$PTOLEMY/src/domains/c50/target/{DSKC50Target,SubC50Target}.{h,cc} -
				- In the Ptolemy0.6.1 development tree,
				we added new functionality to CG.  These
				eight files must be patched to back out that
				functionality, or else we would have to
				include src/domains/cg in this patch, which
				would break all the other code generation
				domains.
	
	The file ptolemy/src/domains/c50/pt-0.6.c50.patch is a patch
	that makes the above changes.  To patch the vanilla Ptolemy
	0.6 sources, do:

	cd $PTOLEMY; patch -p3 < $PTOLEMY/src/domains/c50/pt-0.6.c50.patch
 
	patch binaries for HPUX10.01, Solaris2.4 and SunOS4.1.3 are
	available via anonymous ftp in the hppa, sol2 and sun4
	subdirectories at ftp://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/pub/gnu

3) Run make depend in the c50 directory.
	If you don't do this step, you will see messages like:
	
	make[1]: *** No rule to make target
	`../../../../src/domains/cg/kernel/ImplementationCost.h',
	needed by `C50Target.o'.  Stop.
	
	cd $PTOLEMY/src/domains/c50; make depend

4) Rebuild Ptolemy.  See the Installation Guide in Appendix A of the
	User's manual for details.	
	
	If you have a prexisting obj.$PTARCH tree, you will need to
	run MAKEARCH by hand to create the libptdsp and c50 object
	directories:
	
	If you already have a obj.$PTARCH tree, the following commands
	should build and install a pigiRpc that has the c50 domain:
		cd $PTOLEMY; csh -f MAKEARCH
		cd $PTOLEMY/obj.$PTARCH/domains/c50; make install
		cd $PTOLEMY/obj.$PTARCH/utils/libptdsp; make install
		cd $PTOLEMY/obj.$PTARCH/pigiRpc; make install
		
5) To view the c50 demos, start Ptolemy with:
		pigi $PTOLEMY/src/domains/c50/demo/init.pal
	
	Note that most of the demos just produce c50 code.
	
Using the c50 domain
--------------------

The C50 domain is meant to run on a Linux machine with the DSK starter
board and kit.  The C50 files are downloaded to the chip via a dos shell.

The scripts asmc50 and loadc50 are bash scripts that worked for us
locally.  These scripts probably won't work as is, and will require
modificatoin.
