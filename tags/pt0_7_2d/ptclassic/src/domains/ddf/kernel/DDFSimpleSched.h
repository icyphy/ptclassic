 (Based on DDFClustSched, by Soonhoi Ha)

 This is a simple DDF scheduler where
 a basic iteration consists of as many firings as possible, but no
 more than one per actor.  An iteration can consist of more than one
 basic iteration if a pragma is set indicating that a particular star
 should fire some number of times to define an iteration.
 This is meant to replace DynDFScheduler, but for now, inherits
 from it.
