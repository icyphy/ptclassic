 Declaration for DDF Target, the default target to be used in the DDF
 domain. 

 If useFastScheduler is non-zero, we use the DDF scheduler distributed
 with Ptolemy 0.5.2.

 If restructure is 1, SDF stars are collected into clusters and scheduled
 by the SDF scheduler. This is an experimental facility and currently
 does not work with wormholes.  A safer alternative for the time being
 is to manually create SDF wormholes when the effeciency is desired.
