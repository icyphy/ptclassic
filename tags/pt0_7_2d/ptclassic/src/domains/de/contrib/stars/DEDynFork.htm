<h2>Details</h2><p>
<h3>Creating a porthole dynamically is as follows (<i>createPortHole</i>):</h3>
<p> 
This method is called from <tt>DEDynMapBase::createDynBlock</tt> whenever a new 
block is to put into the system configuration. It just creates a new porthole 
in the <i>out</i>-multiporthole. A pointer to the porthole is returned. The number of the porthole is not needed here, we just need the same interface as in the <tt>DEDynForkXXX</tt>-stars.
<p>        
<h3>Removing a porthole dynamically is as follows (<i>removePortHole</i>):</h3>
<p> 
This method is called from <tt>DEDynMapBase::deleteDynBlock</tt> whenever a 
block is to be taken out of the system configuration. From 
<tt>DEDynMapBase::deleteDynBlock</tt> we get a pointer to one of the portholes 
in our<i>out</i>-multiporthole. We delete it from the block's porthole list as well as from the multiporthole's list and delete the porthole itself.
