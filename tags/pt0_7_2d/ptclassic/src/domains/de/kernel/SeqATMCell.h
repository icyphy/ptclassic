// Default values set for SeqATMCell to contain 53 bytes with
// 8 bits/byte or 424 bits. The variable "cell" will be a pointer
// to an array of (unsigned short)-types. The array will be large
// enough to contain designated number of bits. The SeqATMCell idea,
// as well as much of the following code, was taken from
// C++ PRIMER by Stanley B. Lippman, Addison Weslsey, 2nd ed., 1991.
