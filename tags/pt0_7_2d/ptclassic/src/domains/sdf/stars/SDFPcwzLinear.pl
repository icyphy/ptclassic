defstar {
	name { PcwzLinear }
	domain { SDF }
	desc {
This star implements a piecewise linear mapping from the
input to the output.  The mapping is given by a sequence
of (x,y) pairs, which specify the breakpoints in the function.
The sequence of x values must be increasing. The function
implemented by the star can be represented by drawing straight
lines between the (x,y) pairs, in sequence.  The default
mapping is the "tent" map, in which inputs between -1.0
and 0.0 are linearly mapped into the range -1.0 to 1.0.
Inputs between 0.0 and 1.0 are mapped into the same range,
but with the opposite slope, 1.0 to -1.0. If the input is
outside the range specified in the "x" values of the breakpoints,
then the appropriate extreme value will be used for the output.
Thus, for the default map, if the input is -2.0, the output
will be -1.0.  If the input is +2.0, the output will again be -1.0.
