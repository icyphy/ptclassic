    Are these "recursion" tests or "regression" tests?  I had always
    thought it was the latter.  Are both valid names for tests, or is
    it one or the other?
    
    What do you need in order to have such a test, and in order to use
    it properly?
--------
Currently the tests in src/domains/sdf/test use obj.$PTARCH/ptcl/ptcl.ptiny

Here's how to run them:
ptuser@carson 10% cd ~ptdesign/src/domains/sdf/test
ptuser@carson 11% make
echo "set TYCHO /users/ptdesign/tycho; foreach i [list testSDFStars.tcl testSDFArith.tcl testSDFConv.tcl testSDFDSP.tcl] {puts \$i; source \$i};     puts \"Total: [expr \$PASSED + \$FAILED] (Passed: \$PASSED Failed: \$FAILED)\"" | \
	../../../../obj.sol2.5/ptcl/ptcl.ptiny
testSDFStars.tcl
testSDFArith.tcl
testSDFConv.tcl

You can use any ptcl binary by setting the PTCL variable.  For
example, to run the tests under the 0.7 ptcl, do:

make PTCL=/usr/eesww/share/ptolemy/bin.sol2.5/ptcl

Unfortunately, the test suite will not work with Ptolemy0.6, since we
use 'file join' in a few places.

You can manually run the tests by sourcing 
/users/ptdesign/src/domains/sdf/test/testSDFDefs.tcl
and then what ever test file in that directory you are interested in
running.
