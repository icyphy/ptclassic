This implementation replaces an older one by E. Lee.

InfString is just like StringList with a cast to char*.  Even though the
resulting type is char*, the string that is returned should not be
modified, except for code like that in Tcl that undoes its modification
before returning.

All the functionality is actually in StringList, and the StringList.chars()
method works just fine.

See the warnings in StringList.h about possible problems with early
destruction of temporaries when using the (char*) cast.

Since InfString is publicly inherited from StringList, any routine that
wants a StringList can be given an InfString instead, but *not* vice
versa, so it is not a good idea to require InfString arguments (less
flexibility)
