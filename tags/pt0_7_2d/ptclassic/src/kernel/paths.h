The pathSearch routine was formerly in Linker.cc.  It searches for a
file on the colon-separated directory path given by the path argument
If path is omitted or null, the environment variable PATH is used.

progNotFound returns true and produces an error message if the program
is not found in the PATH, otherwise false is returned.
