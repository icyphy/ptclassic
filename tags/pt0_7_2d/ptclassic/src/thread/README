$PTOLEMY/src/thread/README

This directory contains the sources for GNU threads (gthreads) and a
C++ posix threads interface.

In Ptolemy, threads are used by the Process Network (PN) domain.  As
of Ptolemy0.6, the PN domain only works under SunOS4 and Solaris2.x.
The PN domain should work under HPUX-10.x, but there are a few
remaining bugs.

In Ptolemy0.6, we are distributing gthreads-2.7 with a few minor
modifications, which are contained in gthreads.patch.
