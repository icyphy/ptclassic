25	different way to deal with multiples

11	user annotations (first cool new idea since March!) (could have set of different annotations but would that be useful?) (automatically jump to first highlight?)
17	mandesc-like directory dance hall (clamored for by Oyvind Yrke)
	>2000 lines, 70K characters, despite kicking generally useful code into taputils.tcl

28	fixed deep weirdness, write protected home directory bugs (Dave Glowacki)
1 Apr	first anniversary
12 May	list of all man pages with highlights (Steven S. Dick)
23	help page maintained in HTML, compiled to Tk text and [tn]roff (can zap linebreaks so get good linebreaking on all screen sizes!)
5 Jun	would like to use idiom like: menubutton -menu [set m [menu $w.x.m]], but have to do this: set m $w.x.m; menubutton -menu $m; menu $m
6 Aug	experiment in moving database to Glimpse
10	compressed list of all man page names works great: < 40K in size (with gzip), quick to search (preserves pattern matching), since kept on disk reduces startup time and memory image runs off tkmandesc orderings so can still do wild additions, section dumps efficient
24	search within virtual sections too
	finds names with dots (again)
26	incremental search highlights match
	try to find needed binaries beforehand, abort if can't (Keith Vetter among others)

6	validity checks on components of MANPATH
9	hookup with Glimpse for fulltext search only (& optionally)
12	1.6beta testing
16	glimpse AND apropos, both now dumping results into a pseudo volume
	Perl's out, only Tcl for formatting volumes... sigh
17	automatically rebuild database every month
22	if current mandir != mandir used to build database, automatically rebuild it
26	automatically rebuild database if change in MANPATH or tkmandesc commands
27	-rebuildandquit option (Dietmar Theobald)
	instead of monthly rebuilds, simply check dates of mandirs--it takes a noticable amount of time, but not excessively long (Dietmar Theobald)
29	Volume lists dynamically created, once again controlled by Paths (push from Kevin L. Short)
	database validity check information moved into .tkmandatabase
30 Sep	1.6gamma testing
7 Oct	use simple priority number to choose better the right manual page (why didn't I think of this before?)
31 Oct	list of new/changed manual pages, if any, as pseudovolume

10&11	preferences panels (code now >100K characters, >3000 lines)
21	Support for proposed Linux FSSTND /var/catman
23	deep-six the problematic mandir variable and suck up all unique names in manN*/* and catN*/* assuming they're in manN*/* => takes to long to build database
25	abolished mandir variable (which so many didn't set correctly)
	if no manN, check for catN automatically.  lose on stray cats, though
29	manDescAdd also makes that directory available to Glimpse
	Tcl code indention: spaces => tabs, saving 9K
7 Dec	1.6delta testing
8	IBM AIX support: first need to convert InfoExplorer files to /usr/man/cat*. can't parse pages (so don't), so lose on Sections, Links.  but everything else OK
9	restored SGI support (oops!)
15	bad variable values in old save file automatically updated (Martin Forssen & Greg McFarlane)
17	"(none)"'s changed to -state disabled's (don't have someone try it and fail)

29	new idiom for menubuttons + menus



1995
1 Jan	time to display page once found cut by more than a third by (1) changing while {[gets $fid line]!=1} {eval $line} to while {![eof $fid]} {eval [gets $fid]} and (2) hacking tkText.c to accept multiple (text,tags+mark) pairs
20	right pseudosection set for Shortcuts
