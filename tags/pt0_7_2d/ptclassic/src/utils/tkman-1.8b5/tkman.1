\fIIf you send me bug reports and/or suggestions for new features, 
include your MANPATH, the versions of TkMan, Tcl, Tk, X, and 
UNIX, your machine and X window manager names, the edited Makefile, 
a copy of your \fI~/.tkman \fR file, and the first few lines 
of the \fItkman \fR executable. Otherwise don't waste my time. 
.SH "INTRODUCTION "
A graphical manual page browser, TkMan offers two major advantages 
over man(1)  and xman : hypertext links to other man pages (click 
on a word in the text which corresponds to a man page, and you 
jump there), and better navigation within long man pages with 
searches (both incremental and regular expression) and jumps 
to section headers. TkMan also offers some convenience features, 
like a user-configurable list of commonly used man pages, a one-click 
printout, and integration of whatis  and apropos . Further, one 
may highlight, as if with a yellow marker, arbitrary passages 
of text in man pages and subsequently jump directly to these 
passages by selecting an identifying excerpt from a pulldown 
menu. Finally, TkMan gives one control over the directory-to-menu 
volume mapping of man pages with a capability similar to but 
superior to \fIxman \fR's mandesc in that rather than forcing 
all who share a man directory to follow a single organization, 
TkMan gives control to the individual. For instance, one may 
decide he has no use for a large set of man pages--say for instance 
the programmer routines in volumes 2, 3, 4, 8--and eliminate 
them from his personal database, or a Tcl/Tk programmer may decide 
to group Tcl/Tk manual pages in their own volume listing. 
.PP
Other features include: 
\.br
* full text search of manual pages (with Glimpse; optional) 
\.br
* when multiple pages match the search name, a pulldown list 
of all matches 
\.br
* regular expression searches for manual page names 
\.br
* a list of recently added or changed manual pages 
\.br
* a "history" list of the most recently visited pages 
\.br
* a preferences panel to control fonts, colors, and other system 
settings 
\.br
* compatibility with compressed pages (both as source and formatted) 
\.br
* diagnostics on your manual page installation 
\.br
* elision of those unsightly page headers and footers 
\.br
* and, when attempting to print a page available only in formatted 
form, reverse compilation into [tn]roff source, which can then 
be reformatted as good-looking PostScript.

This help page is shipped with the distribution in HTML form 
for easy printing. 
.SH "USING TKMAN "
.SS "Locating a man page "
There are several ways to specify the manual page you desire. 
You can type its name into the entry box at the top of the screen 
and press \fIReturn \fR or click the \fIman \fR button. The name 
may be just the name of the command or may end with \fI. \fR\fI
n \fR or \fI( \fR\fIn \fR\fI) \fR, where \fIn \fR specifies in 
which section to look. Man pages are matched using regular expressions, 
so you can use \fI. \fR to match any single character, \fI* \fR
to match any (zero or more) of the previous regular expression, \fI[ \fR.. \fI] \fR
to match any single character in the enclosed class; see egrep 
for more information. For instance, .*mail.*.1  searches section 1 (user 
commands) for commands with "mail" anywhere in their names. Likewise, 
one can collect all the various manual pages relating to Perl 5 
with perl.* , or see a list of all X window managers with .*wm . 
If you're running TkMan from a shell and giving it an initial 
man page name to load up as an argument, use this syntax (adequately 
quoted for protection from the shell), as opposed to the syntax 
of the standard \fIman \fR command (which is \fIman \fR\fIsection \fR\fI
name \fR--that is, the section number comes first, whereas in 
TkMan it is part of the name. 
.PP
Usually TkMan searches the directories in your MANPATH \fR environment 
variable for the man page, but you may instead provide a path 
name for the man page by beginning it with \fI`~' \fR, \fI`/' \fR, \fI`.' \fR
or \fI`..' \fR; this is the way to access a man page which isn't 
installed in a MANPATH \fR man directory. Further, other Tcl 
interpreters may display a man page in TkMan by \fIsend \fRing 
a message to the function \fImanShowMan \fR with the name of 
the desired man page, e.g. \fIsend tkman manShowMan tcl.n \fR. 
If multiple man page names match the specification, the first 
match (as searched for in MANPATH \fR order) is shown and a pulldown 
menu appears which contains a list of the other matches. Return 
from reading help or a volume listing to the last man page seen 
with \fIC-m \fR when the focus is in the main text display area. 
.PP
\fIapropos \fR information is available by typing the name and 
clicking \fIapropos \fR or hitting Shift-Return. The output of \fI
apropos \fR is piped through \fIsort \fR and \fIuniq \fR to remove 
duplicates. To pass the matches through additional filters, simply 
give the pipe as in a shell, e.g., ` \fIsearch | grep ^g \fR' (each 
space character is significant) returns all the search-related 
commands which begin with the letter \fIg \fR. The results of 
the last apropos query are available under the \fIVolumes \fR
menu. 
.PP
You may also see a button for \fIglimpse \fR, a full text search 
program that requires only small index files ("typically 2-5% 
the size of the original text" but larger percentages for smaller 
amounts of text), written by Udi Manber, Sun Wu, and Burra Gopal 
of the University of Arizona's Department of Computer Science. 
In their performance measurements, "a search for Schwarzkopf 
allowing two misspelling errors in 5600 files occupying 77MB 
took 7 seconds on a SUN IPC". For example, one may search for 
the string `WWW' anywhere in any manual page by typing in `WWW' 
in the entry line at the top of the screen and clicking on the \fI
glimpse \fR button or typing \fIMeta-Return \fR (for meta-information, 
of course). \fIEscape \fR and \fIC-g \fR can interrupt a search 
after the current directory is done. To employ \fIglimpse \fR's 
command line options, simply place them before the search pattern 
in the entry box, or add them to the default options by editing 
the \fIman(glimpse) \fR variable in your \fI~/.tkman \fR startup 
file (see Customizing TkMan, below). For instance, to search 
for "perl" as a word and not part of another word (as in "properly"), 
glimpse for \fI-w perl \fR. Glimpse supports an \fIAND \fR operation 
denoted by the symbol \fI`;' \fR and an \fIOR \fR operation denoted 
by the symbol \fI`,' \fR. Refer to the glimpse  manual page for 
more information. The regular expression used by \fIglimpse \fR
automatically sets the intrapage search expression. For this 
reason, the case sensitivity of the glimpsing is set to the same 
intrapage. A complete set of matches from the last full text 
search is available under the \fIVolumes \fR menu. 
.PP
The \fIPaths \fR pulldown gives you complete control over which 
directory hierarchies of your MANPATH \fR are searched for man 
pages and apropos information. You can call up a listing of all 
man pages in a volume through the \fIVolumes \fR pulldown menu 
and then select one to view by double-clicking on its name. New `pseudo-volumes' 
can be added, and arbitrary directories may be added to or deleted 
from a volume listing using tkmandesc commands, described below. 
In a volume listing, typing a letter jumps to the line in the 
listing starting with that letter (capital and lower case letters 
are distinct). Return to the last volume seen with \fIC-d \fR
when the focus is in the main text display area. 
.PP
Whenever you have a man page name in the text display box, whether 
from apropos, a volume listing or a reference within another 
man page, you can double-click on it to hypertext-jump to it. 
Pressing shift while double-clicking opens up a new viewer box 
to display the page. 
.PP
The last few man pages you looked at can be accessed directly 
through the \fIHistory \fR pulldown menu. The list is sorted 
top to bottom in order of increasing time since that page was 
last visited. \fIShortcuts \fR lists your personal favorites 
and is used just like \fIHistory \fR, with the additional options 
of adding the current man page (by clicking \fI+ \fR) or removing 
it ( \fI- \fR) from the list. A shift-click on \fI- \fR removes 
all shortcuts. 
.PP
(Man pages specified as above are processed through an \fInroff \fR
filter. TkMan can also read raw text from a file or from a command 
pipeline, which can then be read, searched and highlighted same 
as a man page. To read from a file, make the first character 
in the name a \fI< \fR, as in \fI<~/foo.txt \fR. To open a pipe, 
make the first character a \fI| \fR (vertical bar), as in ` \fI|gzcat 
foo.txt.gz \fR' or ` \fI|cat ../foo.txt | grep bar \fR' (that's 
no space after the first \fI| \fR, a space before and after any 
subsequent ones). After reading a file in this way, the current 
directory is set to its directory. Commands are not processed 
by a shell, but the metacharacters \fI. \fR, \fI.. \fR, \fI~ \fR
and \fI$ \fR (for environment variables), are expanded nonetheless. 
Typing is eased further by file name completion, bound to \fI
Escape \fR. Lone files (i.e., not part of a pipe) are automatically 
uncompressed--no need to read compressed files through a \fIzcat \fR
pipe. It is not expected that reading raw text will be done much; 
it is included so the occasional non-man page documentation, 
say, a FAQ or RFC, may be read from the same environment.) 
.SS "Working within a man page "
The full pathname of the current manual page is shown at the 
top of the screen. Via the Preferences dialog, this can be changed 
to the whatis  information for the page. (whatis information 
is build by catman .) 
.PP
To the extent it follows conventional formatting, a manual page 
is parsed to yield its section and subsection titles (which are 
directly available from the \fISections \fR pulldown) and references 
to other man pages from throughout the page including its SEE 
ALSO \fR section ( \fILinks \fR pulldown). One may jump directly 
to a section within a man page or a referenced man page, respectively, 
by selecting the corresponding entry from one of these pulldowns. 
.PP
Within a man page or raw text file or pipe, you may add ad hoc 
highlighting, as though with a yellow marker (underlining on 
monochrome monitors). Highlighted regions may then be scrolled 
to directly through the \fIHighlights \fR pulldown menu. To highlight 
a region, select the desired text by clicking button 1, dragging 
to the far extent of the desired region and releasing the button, 
then click on the \fI+ \fR next to \fIHighlights \fR. To remove 
any highlights or portions thereof in a region, select it as 
before but then click on \fI- \fR. A shift-click on the menu 
title tours through all the highlights on the page. A shift-click 
on \fI- \fR removes all highlights on the page. A complete set 
of pages with highlighting is available under the \fIVolumes \fR
menu. 
.PP
Highlighting information is robust against changes to and reformatting 
of the page. Here's how highlight reattachment works. When you 
highlight a region, the starting and ending positions are saved 
along with some the content of the highlighted region and context. 
When that page is viewed again, if those positions still match 
the context, the highlight is attached there (this is an exact 
match). If not, the context is searched forward and backward 
for a match, with the closer match chosen if there are matches 
in both directions (a repositioned match). If no match is found 
with the full context, gradually less and less of it is tried, 
reasoning that perhaps the content of the context has been changed (repositioned, 
but with less confidence, triggering a warning dialog). If still 
no match is found (an orphan), the highlight is reported at the 
bottom of the page, where it must be reattached manually before 
leaving the page or it will be forgotten. (Before TkMan v1.8b4, 
highlights were attached by positions only, and when the page 
modification date changed, the user had the choice of applying 
highlights at those same positions regardless of the text there 
now or throwing out the highlights wholesale. Old style highlights 
are automatically updated to the new style that can be automatically 
and robustly repositioned. The next time an old style page is 
viewed, the old style highlights are applied as before, and from 
those postions new style highlights are composed.) The annotation 
reattachment mechanism is inspried by Stanford's ComMentor system. 
.PP
You can move about the man page by using the scrollbar or typing 
a number of key combinations familiar to Emacs aficionados. Space 
and \fIC-v \fR page down, and delete and \fIM-v \fR page up. \fI
C-n \fR and \fIC-p \fR scroll up and down, respectively, by a 
single line ( \fIvi \fR fans will be happy to hear that \fIC-f \fR
and \fIC-b \fR also page down and page up, respectively). \fI
M-< \fR goes to the head and \fIM-> \fR to the tail of the text. 
One may "scan" the page, which is to say scroll it up and down 
with the mouse but without the use of the scrollbar, by dragging 
on the text display with the middle mouse button pressed. Like 
Emacs, \fIC-space \fR will mark one's current location, which 
can be returned to later with \fIC-x \fR, which exchanges the 
then-current position with the saved mark; a second \fIC-x \fR
swaps back. 
.PP
\fIC-s \fR initiates an incremental search. Subsequently typing 
a few letters attempts to find a line with that string, starting 
its search at the current match, if any, or otherwise the topmost 
visible line. A second \fIC-s \fR finds the next match of the 
string typed so far. (If the current search string is empty, 
a second \fIC-s \fR retrieves the previous search pattern.) \fI
C-r \fR is similar to \fIC-s \fR but searches backwards. \fIEscape \fR
or \fIC-g \fR cancels searching. Incremental search can be used 
to quickly locate a particular command-line option or a particular 
command in a group (as in \fIcsh \fR's long list of internal 
commands). At the bottom of the screen, type in a regular expression 
to search for (see Tcl's regexp  command), and hit return or 
click \fISearch \fR to begin a search. Hit \fIC-s \fR, click 
the down arrow or keep hitting return to search for the next 
occurance; likewise \fIC-r \fR or the up arrow for previous occurances. 
.PP
The \fITab \fR key moves the focus from the man page type-in 
line to the text view of the man page to the search line and 
back around. \fIShift-Tab \fR jumps about in the opposite direction. 
.SS "Other commands "
The \fIOccasionals \fR menu holds commands and options which 
you probably won't frequently. \fIHelp \fR returns to this information 
screen. Although virtually made obsolete by TkMan, \fIKill Trees \fR
makes a printout of the current man page on dead, cut, bleached 
trees, helping to starve the planet of life-giving oxygen. A 
list of printers appears in the cascade menu; this list may be 
edited in Preferences/Misc. (Even if only one printer is available, 
it placed in the cascade menu, rather than being directly available. 
This is a feature.) (If the \fI[tn]roff \fR source is not available, 
TkMan asks if it should try to reverse compile the man page. 
If successful, this produces much more appealing output than 
an ASCII \fR dump.) By default, incremental searching is not 
case sensitive, but regular expression searching is; these settings 
can be toggled with the next two menus. \fIiff upper \fR means 
that searching is case sensitive if and only if their is at least 
one uppercase letter in the search expression--that is, all lowercase 
searches are not case sensitive; this idea is taken from Emacs. 
With proportional fonts giving a ragged right margin, any change 
bars in the right margin will form an uneven line; by opting 
for \fIChangebars on left \fR, they will form a straight line 
at the left margin. 
.PP
As with \fIxman \fR one may instantiate multiple viewers. When 
there is more than one viewer you may choose man pages in one 
viewer and have their contents shown in another. Use the \fIOutput \fR
pulldown (which appears and disappears as relevant) to direct 
one viewer's output destination to another. With this feature 
one may easily compare two similar man pages for differences, 
keep one man page always visible, or examine several man pages 
from a particular volume listing or a SEE ALSO \fR section. \fI
Output \fR only affects the display destination of man pages. 
TkMan uses a database of all manual page names in searching for 
a match for a particular name. This database is constructed automatically 
if it doesn't exist (this includes the first time TkMan is run 
for a particular user) and whenever it is out of date due to 
pages being added or changed, or changes in one's MANPATH \fR
or tkmandesc commands. (If you want to add paths to your MANPATH \fR, 
or edit \fI~/.tkman \fR, you will have to restart to see any 
changes take effect, however.) If you install new manual pages, 
invoking \fIRebuild Database \fR will permit them to show up 
in the next search or volume listing without the bother of quitting 
and re-executing TkMan. \fIRebuild Glimpse Database \fR creates 
and then maintains the index that is used for full text searches. 
The Glimpse database is not maintained automatically. When exited 
via the \fIQuit \fR button TkMan saves its state. One may guard 
against losing highlighting, shortcuts and other what-should-be 
persistent information without quitting by by invoking \fICheckpoint 
state to .tkman \fR; \fIQuit, don't update \fR performs the opposite 
operation. 
.PP
At the bottom right corner of the screen, \fIMono \fR toggles 
between the proportionally-spaced font and a monospaced one, 
for use in those man pages that rely on a fixed-width font to 
align columns. \fIQuit \fR exits TkMan, of course, after saving 
some state information (see below). To exit without saving status 
information, select the \fIQuit \fR option from the \fIOccasionals \fR
pulldown. 
.SS "Preferences "
The \fIPreferences... \fR choice in the \fIOccasionals \fR pulldown 
menu brings up a graphical user interface to setting various 
attributes of TkMan, including fonts, colors, and icons. Click 
on a checkbutton at the top of the window to bring up the corresponding 
group of choices. After making a set of choices, the \fIApply \fR
button reconfigures the running application to show these changes, \fI
OK \fR sets the changes for use now and in the future, \fICancel \fR
quits the dialog and sets all choices to their settings as of 
the time Preferences was called up, and \fIDefaults \fR resets 
the settings in the current group to those set by TkMan out of 
the box. 
.PP
The first line in the Fonts group specifies the font to use for 
the general user interface, which amounts to the labels on buttons 
and the text in menus. The first menu in the line labeled \fI
Interface \fR sets the font family, the next menu sets the font 
size, and the last the font styling (normal, bold, italics, bold-italics). \fI
Text display \fR makes these settings for the text box in which 
the manual pages contents are displayed. For listings of all 
man pages in a particiular volume (as chosen with the \fIVolumes \fR
menu), you may wish to use a smaller font so that more names 
fit on the screen at once. \fIScreen DPI \fR specifies the right 
set of fonts to use for your monitor. 
.PP
Colors sets the foreground and background colors to use for the 
manual page text display box, the general user interface, and 
the buttons of the user interface. In addition it sets the color (or 
font) in which to show various classes of text in the text box, 
including manual page references, incremental search hits, regular 
expression search hits, and highlighted regions. 
.PP
The See group specifies what information to display. Usually 
manual page headers and footers are uninteresting and therefore 
are stripped out, but a canonical header and footer (along the 
date the page was installed in the \fIman/man \fR\fIn \fR directory 
or formatted to the \fIman/cat \fR\fIn \fR directory) to be shown 
at the bottom of every page can be requested. Solaris and IRIX 
systems come with many "subvolumes"--that is volumes with names 
like "3x" and "4dm" that form subgroupings under the main volumes "3" 
and "4", respectively--and you make use tkmandesc commands to 
add your own subvolumes. You can reduce the length of the main \fI
Volumes \fR menu by placing all volumes in such groups as cascaded 
menus. When a highlighted passage is jumped to via the \fIHighlights \fR
menu, some number of lines of back context are included; the 
exact number of lines is configurable. The information bar at 
the top of the window can display either the short, one-line 
description from a manual page's NAME section or the pathname 
of the page. Around the man page display area runs a buffer region, 
the exact width of which is configurable. Tk deviates from Motif 
behavior slightly, as for instance in highlighting buttons when 
they're under the cursor, but you can observe strict Motif behavior. 
.PP
The Icon group sets all the options relating to iconification. 
The pathnames of the icon bitmap and icon mask should be the 
full pathnames (beginning with a `/'). 
.PP
If a man page has not been formatted by \fInroff \fR, TkMan must 
first pipe the source text through \fInroff \fR. By turing on \fI
Cache formatted (nroff'ed) pages \fR in the Misc(ellaneous) group, 
the \fInroff \fR-formatted text is saved to disk (if possible), 
thereby eliminating this time-consuming step the next time the 
man page is read. The \fIon & compress \fR setting will compress 
the page, which saves on disk space (often substantially as much 
of a formatted page is whitespace), but will make it unavailable 
to other manual pagers that don't handle compression. By default 
man page links are activated by double clicking. The first click 
puts the name in the entry box so that it can be used as the 
apropos or glimpse pattern as well. This click once to select, 
twice to launch follows the Macintosh convention. Since TkMan 
was written, some hypertext browsers have popularized a click-once-to-launch 
practice. The \fIMouse click to activate hyperlink \fR switch 
chooses between the two. TkMan can extract section headers from 
all manual pages, but only some manual page macros format \fI
sub \fRsection headers in a way that can be distinguished from 
ordinary text; if your macros do, turn this option on to add 
subsections to the \fISections \fR menu. The \fIHistory \fR pulldown 
must balance depth of the list against ease of finding an entry; 
set your own inflection point with this menu. \fIVolumes' \fR\fI(recent) \fR
choice will show all manual pages that have been added or changed \fI
n \fR days, where \fIn \fR is set with this next menu. Glimpse 
works best when searching for relatively uncommon words; guard 
against getting too many hits by setting the maximum number reported. 
By default Glimpse indexes are placed at the root of the corresponding 
man hierarchy, where they can be shared. For the case when an 
individual may not have write permission there, a single, unified 
index can be created and stored locally (though you lose control 
of it from the Paths settings). Unified indexes are much faster 
that distributed. In this latter case and also for "stray cats" (i.e., 
directories not part of a set of man hierarchy directories), 
you should specify an auxiliary directory to hold the index. 
Proportional spacing wrecks the spacing used to set tables in 
columns, hence the \fIMono \fR(space) button on the bottom line 
of the main screen. 
.SH "CUSTOMIZING TKMAN "
There are four levels of configuration to TkMan. 
.PP
(1) Transparent. Simply use TkMan and it will remember your window 
size and placement, short cuts, and highlights (if you quit out 
of TkMan via the \fIQuit \fR button). 
.PP
(2) Preferences editor (see Preferences above). 
.PP
(3) Configuration file. Most interesting settings, like the command(s) 
used to print the man page and some key bindings, can be changed 
by editing one's own \fI~/.tkman \fR. Thus, a single copy of 
TkMan (i.e., the executable \fItkman \fR) can be shared, but 
each user can have his own customized setup. (The file \fI~/.tkman \fR
is created/rewritten every time one quits TkMan via the \fIQuit \fR
button in the lower right corner. Therefore, to get a \fI~/.tkman \fR
to edit, first run and quit TkMan. Do not create one from scratch 
as it will not have the proper format used for saving other persistent 
information, and your work will be overwritten, which is to say 
lost.) Be careful not to edit a ~/.tkman file only to have it 
overwritten when a currently-running TkMan quits. 
.PP
Options that match the defaults are commented out (i.e., preceded 
by a \fI# \fR). This is so that any changes in the defaults will 
propagate nicely, while the file still lists all interesting 
variables. To override the default settings for these options, 
first comment in the line. 
.PP
The ~/.tkman save file is the place to add or delete colors to 
the default set, which will subsequently become menu choices 
in Preferences, by \fBediting in place \fR the variable \fIman(colors) \fR. 
One may also edit the order of Shortcuts in the \fIman(shortcuts) \fR
variable. Other interesting variables include \fIman(highlight) \fR, 
which can be edited to change the background in place of the 
foreground, or both the foreground \fIand \fR background, or 
a color \fIand \fR the font as with the following setting: 
\.br
\fIset man(highlight) {bold-italics -background #ffd8ffffb332} \fR
.PP
Arbitrary Tcl commands, including tkmandesc commands (described 
below), can be appended to \fI~/.tkman \fR (after the \fI### 
your additions go below \fR line). 
.PP
To set absolutely the volume names for which all directories 
should be searched, \fBedit \fR the parallel arrays on these \fB
existing \fR lines: 
\.br
\fIset man(manList) ... \fR
\.br
\fIset man(manTitleList) ... \fR
\.br
Changing the order volumes in these lists (make sure to keep 
the two lists in parallel correspondence) changes the precedence 
of matches when two or more pages have the same name: the page 
found in the earlier volume in this list is show first. 
.PP
Additional useful commands include wm(n) , which deals with the 
window manager; bind(n) , which changes keyboard and mouse bindings 
not related to the text display window; options , which sets 
the X defaults; and text(n) , which describes the text widget. 
.PP
(4) Source code. Of course, but if you make generally useful 
changes or have suggestions for some, please report them back 
to me so I may share the wealth with the next release. 
.SS "Command line options "
The environment variable named TKMAN \fR, if it exists, is used 
to set command line options. Any options specified explicitly (as 
from a shell or in a script) override the settings in TKMAN \fR. 
Any settings made with command-line options apply for the current 
execution only. Many of these options can be set persistently 
via the Preferences dialog (under the \fIOccasionals \fR menu). 
.TP 15
\fI-title \fR\fItitle \fR
Place \fI\fR\fItitle \fR in the window's title bar. 
.TP 15
\fI-geometry \fR\fIgeometry \fR
Specify the geometry for this invocation only. To assign a persistent 
geometry, start up TkMan, size and place the window as desired, 
then (this is important) quit via the \fIQuit \fR button in the 
lower right corner. 
.TP 15
\fI-iconify \fR and \fI-!iconify \fR
Start up iconified or uniconified (the default), respectively.

startup file; "" indictates no startup file. 
.TP 15
\fI-database \fR\fIfilename \fR
Use \fI\fR\fIfilename \fR in place of \fI~/.tkmandatabase \fR
as the name of the file in which to create the database of man 
page names. This can point to a shared file to save disk space 
or share a custom design, or to an OS-specific file for systems 
with multiple machine architectures that share home directories. 
.TP 15
\fI-rebuildandquit \fR
Simply rebuild the database and quit. This option may be useful 
in a cron script. 
.TP 15
\fI-quit save \fR and \fI-quit nosave \fR
Specify that the startup file (usually \fI~/.tkman \fR) should 
be updated ( \fIsave \fR) or not ( \fInosave \fR) when quitting 
by the \fIQuit \fR button. 
.TP 15
\fI-v \fR

\.br
or \fI-+M \fR\fIpath-list \fR
As with \fIman \fR, change the search path for manual pages to 
the given colon-separated list of directory subtrees. \fI-M+ \fR
appends and \fI-+M \fR prepends these directories to the current 
list. 
.TP 15
\fI-now \fR
Start up TkMan without checking to see if the database is out 
of date. 
.TP 15
\fI--help \fR Display a list of options. 
.SS "Key bindings "
Key bindings related to the text display box are kept in the \fI
sb \fR array in \fI~/.tkman \fR (for more information on Tcl's 
arrays, refer to the array(n)  man page. In editing the \fIsb(key,...) \fR
keyboard bindings, modifiers MUST be listed in the following 
order: \fIM \fR (for meta), \fIC \fR (control), \fIA \fR (alt). 
DO NOT USE SHIFT. It is not a general modifier: Some keyboards 
require shift for different characters, resulting in incompatibilities 
in bindings. For this reason, the status of the shift key is 
supressed in matching for bindings. For instance, \fIset sb(key,M-less) 
pagestart \fR is a valid binding on keyboards worldwide, whereas \fI
set sb(key,MS-less) \fR is not. To make a binding without a modifier 
key, precede the character by `-', as in \fIset sb(key,-space) 
pagedown \fR. 
.SS "tkmandesc "
Like \fIxman \fR, TkMan gives you directory-by-directory control 
over named volume contents. Unlike and superior to \fIxman \fR, 
however, each individual user controls directory-to-volume placement, 
rather than facing a single specification for each directory 
tree that must be observed by all. 
.PP
By default a matrix is created by taking the product of directories 
in the MANPATH \fR crossed with volume names, with the yield 
of each volume containing all the corresponding subdirectories 
in the MANPATH \fR. By adding Tcl commands to your \fI~/.tkman \fR(see 
above), you may add new volume names and add, move, copy and 
delete directories to/from/among directories. 
.PP
The interface to this functionality takes the form of Tcl commands, 
so you may need to learn Tcl--particularly the commands that 
deal with Tcl lists (including lappend(n) , linsert(n) , lrange(n) , 
lreplace(n) ) and string matching ( string(n) , \fImatch \fR 
subcommand)--to use this facility to its fullest. tkmandesc commands 
are used to handle the nonstandard format of SGI's manual page 
directories, and the \fIsgi_bindings.tcl \fR in the \fIcontrib \fR
directory is a good source of examples in the use of tkmandesc 
commands. 
.PP
Directory titles and abbrevations are kept in lists. Abbreviations 
MUST be unique (capital letters are distinct from lower case), 
but need not correspond to actual directories. In fact, volume 
letters specified here supercede the defaults in identifying 
a volume in man page searches. COMMANDS 
.PP
The following commands are \fBappended \fR to the file \fI~/.tkman \fR(see 
Customizing TkMan, above). 
.PP
To recreate a cross product of current section lists: 
\.br
\fImanDescDefaults \fR
\.br
This cross product is made implicitly before other tkmandesc 
commands. Almost always this is what one expects. If it is not, 
one may supress the cross product by setting the variable \fI
manx(defaults) \fR to a non-null, non-zero value before other 
tkmandesc commands are invoked. 
.PP
To add "pseudo" sections to the current volume name list, at 
various positions including at end of the list, in alphabetical 
order, or before or after a specific volume: 
\.br
\fImanDescAddSects \fR\fIlist of (letter, title pairs) \fR
\.br
or \fImanDescAddSects \fR\fIlist of (letter, title) pairs \fR
sort 
\.br
or \fImanDescAddSects \fR\fIlist of (letter, title) pairs \fR
before \fIsect-letter \fR
\.br
or \fImanDescAddSects \fR\fIlist of (letter, title) pairs \fR
after \fIsect-letter \fR
\.br
In manual page searches that produce multiple matches, the page 
found in the earlier volume is the one shown by default. 
.PP
To move/copy/delete/add directories: 
\.br
\fImanDescMove \fR\fIfrom-list \fR\fIto-list \fR\fIdir-patterns-list \fR
\.br
\fImanDescCopy \fR\fIfrom-list \fR\fIto-list \fR\fIdir-patterns-list \fR
\.br
\fImanDescDelete \fR\fIfrom-list \fR\fIdir-patterns-list \fR
\.br
\fImanDescAdd \fR\fIto-list \fR\fIdir-list \fR
.PP
The \fIdir-patterns-list \fR uses the same meta characters as 
man page searching (see above). It is matched against MANPATH \fR
directories with volume subdirectory appended, as in \fI/usr/man/man3 \fR, 
where \fI/usr/man \fR is a component of the MANPATH \fR and \fI
man3 \fR is a volume subdirectory. \fIfrom-list \fR and \fIto-list \fR
are Tcl lists of the unique volume abbreviations (like \fI1 \fR
or \fI3X \fR); \fI* \fR is an abbreviation for all volumes. 
.PP
Adding directories with \fImanDescAdd \fR also makes them available 
to Glimpse for its indexing. 
.PP
Warning: Moving directories from their natural home slightly 
impairs searching speed when following a reference within a man 
page. For instance, say you've moved man pages for X Windows 
subroutines from their natural home in volume 3 to their own 
volume called `X'. Following a reference in \fIXButtonEvent \fR
to \fIXAnyEvent(3X11) \fR first searches volume 3; not finding 
it, TkMan searches all volumes and finally finds it in volume 
X. With no hint to look in volume 3 (as given by the \fI3X11 \fR
suffix), the full volume search would have begun straight away. (Had 
you double-clicked in the volume listing for volume X or specified 
the man page as \fIXButtonEvent.X \fR, volume X would have been 
searched first, successfully.) 
.PP
To help debug tkmandesc scripts, invoke \fImanDescShow \fR to 
dump to stdout the current correspondence of directories to volumes 
names. EXAMPLES 
.PP
(1) To collect together all man pages in default volumes 2 and 3 
in all directories into a volume called "Programmer Subroutines", 
add these lines to the tail of \fI~/.tkman \fR: 
\.br
\fImanDescAddSects {{p "Programmer Subroutines"}} \fR
\.br
\fImanDescMove {2 3} p * \fR
.PP
To place the new section at the same position in the volume pulldown 
list as volumes 2 and 3: 
\.br
\fImanDescAddSects {{p "Programmer Subroutines"}} after 2 \fR
\.br
\fImanDescMove {2 3} p * \fR
.PP
To move only a selected set of directories: 
\.br
\fImanDescAddSects {{p "Programmer Subroutines"}} \fR
\.br
\fImanDescMove * p {/usr/man/man2 /usr/local/man/man3} \fR
.PP
(2) To have a separate volume with all of your and a friend's 
personal man pages, keeping a duplicate in their default locations: 
\.br
\fImanDescAddSects {{t "Man Pages de Tom"} {b "Betty Page(s)"}} \fR
\.br
\fImanDescCopy *phelps* t * \fR
\.br
\fImanDescCopy *page* t * \fR
.PP
(3) To collect the X windows man pages into two sections of their 
own, one for programmer subroutines and another for the others: 
\.br
\fImanDescAddSects {{x "X Windows"}} after 1 \fR
\.br
\fImanDescAddSects {{X "X Subroutines"}} after 3 \fR
\.br
\fImanDescMove * x *X11* \fR
\.br
\fImanDescMove x X *3 \fR
.PP
(4) If you never use the programmer subroutines, why not save 
time and memory by not reading them into the database? 
\.br
\fImanDescDelete * {*[2348]} \fR (braces prevent Tcl from trying 
to execute [2348] as a command) 
.PP
Alternatively but not equivalently: 
\.br
\fImanDescDelete {2 3 4 8} * \fRtkmandesc vs. xman and SGI 
.PP
TkMan's tkmandesc capability is patterned after \fIxman \fR's 
mandesc files. By placing a mandesc file at the root of a man 
page directory tree, one may create pseudo volumes and move and 
copy subdirectories into them. Silicon Graphics has modified \fI
xman \fR so that simply by creating a subdirectory in a regular 
man subdirectory one creates a new volume. This is evil. It violates 
the individual user's rights to arrange the directory-volume 
mapping as he pleases, as the mandesc file or subdirectory that 
spontaneously creates a volume is set a single place and must 
be observed by all who read that directory. By contrast, TkMan 
places the directory-to-volume mapping control in an individual's 
own \fI~/.tkman \fR file. This gives the individual complete 
control and inflicts no pogrom on others who share man page directories. 
Therefore, mandesc files are not supported in any way by TkMan. 
.PP
One may still share custom setups, however, by sharing the relevant 
lines of \fI~/.tkman \fR. In fact, a tkmandesc version of the 
standard SGI man page directory setup is included in the \fIcontrib \fR
directory of the TkMan distribution. For assistance with SGI-specific 
directory manipulation, contact Paul Raines ( \fIraines@bohr.physics.upenn.edu \fR). 
.SH "ROSETTAMAN "
TkMan uses \fIRosettaMan \fR to translate and reformat man pages (see 
man(5) ). \fIRosettaMan \fR (called rman  in its executable form) 
takes formatted man pages from most of the popular flavors of 
UNIX and transforms them into any of a number of text source 
formats. \fIRosettaMan \fR accepts formatted man pages from Hewlett-Packard 
HP-UX, AT&T System V, SunOS, Sun Solaris, OSF/1, DEC Ultrix, 
SGI IRIX, Linux, FreeBSD, SCO. It can produce ASCII-only, section 
headers-only, TkMan, [tn]roff (source), Ensemble, SGML, HTML, 
MIME, LaTeX, LaTeX2e, RTF, Perl 5 POD. A modular architecture 
permits easy addition of additional output formats. The latest 
version of RosettaMan is available from \fIftp://ftp.cs.berkeley.edu/ucb/people/phelps/tcltk/rman.tar.Z \fR.
