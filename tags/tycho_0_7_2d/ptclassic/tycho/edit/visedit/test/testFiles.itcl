# A number of windows will be created, and then some time after, destroyed.
# You should just watch.  Do not push any buttons, or you could trigger
# spurious errors.  If no errors occur during the test, there will be no
# windows left at the end.  Currently, windows are left open for 4 seconds.
# Run from within tycho (can just source this file and execute it).
#
# Limitations:
#  - Modal dialogs are not tested so that the test can proceed automatically.
#  - This is assumed to be run in $PTOLEMY/tycho/kernel_itk.
#  - The tests are by no means complete.
#
# The modal dialogs are adequately tested by the demo script.


# Make sure that the required packages are loaded
package require tycho.util.tytest
package require tycho.edit.visedit
