#### YesNoCancel
# Query the user for a yes/no/cancel response to a question. 
# This class is now somewhat redundant, since YesNoQuery can be used
# (the Escape key serves to Cancel, usually, in that it dismisses
# the window without invoking any of the buttons). The
# command to execute in response to the user's answer can be specified
# using the options "-yescommand", "-nocommand", and "-cancelcommand".
# The value returned by whichever command is executed will be that
# returned by the procedure <code>wait</code>, if that is
# used. By default, the value returned by the cancel button is -1,
# while yes is 1 and no is 0.  If the window is dismissed with Escape,
# then a null string is returned.
#
# Below is a simple example
# <tcl><pre>
# set nm [::tycho::autoName .tYNC]
# ::tycho::YesNoCancel $nm &#92
#     -text "Are you awake?"
# ::tycho::Dialog::wait $nm
# </pre></tcl>
# The value returned will be -1, 0 or 1, depending on which button is hit,
# or an empty string if the user dismisses the window with Escape.
#
class ::tycho::YesNoCancel {
    inherit ::tycho::YesNoQuery

    # The command to execute on a cancel response.
    itk_option define -cancelcommand cancelcommand CancelCommand \
	    "::tycho::Dialog::answer -1"

    constructor {args} {}
