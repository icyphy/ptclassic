# See $TYCHO/doc/tynt.html for instructions

#    1. Tycho refers to the directory where the Tycho distribution is with
#      the environment variable $TYCHO. In unix, under csh, you would do
#       something like setenv TYCHO /usr/local/tycho.
#       
#       You can either hardwire this variable by setting it in the start
#       up script, or under NT, you can set the TYCHO environment variable
#       by clicking on Start, then Settings, then Control Panel and
#       finally the System icon. In the System Properties window that
#       comes up, select Environment. There, you can add TYCHO as a User
#       Variable. Incidentally, this is where you set your path.

# Set the TYCHO variable
if ![info exists env(TYCHO)] {
	set env(TYCHO) "c:/tycho0.3alpha"
}

# If you are having problems, uncomment the next line
# set tyDebug 1

# package require java

source $env(TYCHO)/kernel/Tycho.tcl
