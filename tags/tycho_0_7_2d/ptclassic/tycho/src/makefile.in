# This file is a makefile for the Tycho files that require compilation.

# then it is a template for a makefile;  to generate the actual makefile,
# run "./configure", which is a configuration script generated by the
# "autoconf" program (constructs like "@foo@" will get replaced in the
# actual makefile.
