An index to the Ptolemy distribution
$Id$

In this structure listing, wherever ARCH appears, replace it by
"sun3" if you're running on a Sun 3, "sun4" if you're running on
a Sun 4, "vax" if you're running on a Vax, or "mips" for DecStations
based on the MIPS RISC chips.

If you're on a mixed cluster, more than one version may exist (say, one
containing Sun 3 objects and binaries, and one containing those
for the Sun 4).  To work correctly, the ARCH environment variable
should be set to "sun3" or sun4" (whichever is appropriate).  If
this is done, just typing "make" from the top level directory will
build and install everything.  The top level directory should be
the home directory of the user "ptolemy".

Either the SunOS or GNU version of make is required to successfully
make Ptolemy; the Ultrix versions lack some features we need.

MAKEARCH
	a script to build architecture-specific directories for
	object files, libraries, and binaries.  If the ARCH environment
	variable is "vax", say, it will make bin.vax, lib.vax, obj.vax
	and appropriate subdirectories

bin/	Contains user-executable shell scripts:
	pigi
		Runs the Ptolemy interactive graphics interface
	pigiDebug
		Runs pigi with gdb debugger
bin.ARCH/
	Contains binary user-executables for the ARCH architecture:
	interpreter
		Ptolemy interpreter
	pigiRpc
		"RPC application" run by vem in the "pigi" script
	ptlang
		Ptolemy language preprocessor
	xgraph
		Program for drawing graphs under X11
	optfir, wfir
		Filter design programs
demo/
	Directory containing pigi and interpreter demos.
doc/
	Documentation for the Ptolemy system
lib/
	interpreter.help
		Interpreter help file
	pigiDebugRpc
		Script used by "pigiDebug" script
	pigiXRes
		X11 resource file used by pigi
	technology/
		Directory containing "system facets" for pigi
	vem.bindings.7-3
	vem.bindings.8-1
		VEM bindings files for use with pigi
lib.ARCH/
	interpmain.o
		main() for interpreter
	libddf.a, libsdf.a, libde.a
		Domain-specific support functions
	libptolemy.a
		The "Ptolemy kernel" library
	libpigi.a
		Library routines for Pigi
makefile
	The top level makefile for Ptolemy -- it builds everything
obj.ARCH/
	Directory for building the system on a ARCH architecture.
	It has subdirectories paralleling the subdirectories of src
	and is initially built by MAKEARCH.  That is, it has
	subdirectories domains/, interp/, kernel/, pigiRpc/, preproc/,
	tests/, and xgraph/, and domains/ has subdirectories stars/
	and kernel/.
octtools/
	Contains the parts of the OCT/VEM system required to build
	and run pigi.
	bin.ARCH/
		Contains binaries for ARCH.  Currently contains only
		vem.
	include/
		Contains header files needed to build pigiRpc.
	lib.ARCH/
		Contains OCT libraries needed to build pigiRpc
src/
	Source files and OCT icons for Ptolemy.

Contents of ~ptolemy/src:

domains/
	Domain-specific support:
	ddf/
	de/
	sdf/
		Support for DDF, DE, SDF domains (see below)
	Other experimental domains (with the same structure)
	may live here as well.

	makefile
		Makefile for domain support
example/
	Example of how the user can make a customized interpreter
filters/
	Some filter design programs
interp/
	Stuff to build the interpreter with
kernel/
	The Ptolemy kernel sources
makefile
	Makefile to build everything
pigiExample/
	How to build your own private pigiRpc (not done yet)
pigiRpc/
	Sources for pigi (actually, for the pigiRpc program)
preproc/
	The Ptolemy language preprocessor
xgraph/
	The xgraph program

Each domain (e.g. sdf) has its support in, say, ~ptolemy/domains/sdf.
That directory has the following structure:

demo/
	Pigi demos for the domain
doc/
	Documentation for the domain, with subdirectories:
	demos/
		Documents demos for the domain
	stars/
		Documents stars in the doman.
icons/
	Pigi icons for stars in the domain
kernel/
	Extensions to the kernel to support the domain (sources and
	include files)
makefile
	makefile; makes stuff in kernel/ and stars/
stars/
	Stars that run under the domain.
