An index to the Ptolemy distribution
$Id$

In this structure listing, wherever PTARCH appears, replace it by sol2
if you're running on a Solaris2.x machine, "sun4" if you're running on
a SunOS4.x machine, "hppa" if you're running on a HP.

If you're on a mixed cluster, more than one version may exist (say, one
containing Sun 3 objects and binaries, and one containing those
for the Sun 4).  To work correctly, the PTARCH environment variable
should be set to "sun3" or sun4" (whichever is appropriate).  If
this is done, just typing "make" from the top level directory will
build and install everything.  The top level directory should be
the home directory of the user "ptolemy".

Either the SunOS or GNU version of make is required to successfully
make Ptolemy; the Ultrix versions lack some features we need.

MAKEARCH
	a script to build architecture-specific directories for
	object files, libraries, and binaries.  If the PTARCH environment
	variable is "vax", say, it will make bin.vax, lib.vax, obj.vax
	and appropriate subdirectories

athena.sun4
	(Sun-4 distribution only)
	This directory contains the Athena widget libraries, which are
	needed to run pigi under Open Windows.

bin/	Contains user-executable shell scripts:
	pigi
		Runs the Ptolemy interactive graphics interface
	pigiDebug
		Runs pigi with gdb debugger
bin.PTARCH/
	Contains binary user-executables for the PTARCH architecture:
	interpreter
		Ptolemy interpreter
	pigiRpc
		"RPC application" run by vem in the "pigi" script
	play
		Play sounds to the workstation speaker (sun-4 only)
	ptlang
		Ptolemy language preprocessor
	xgraph
		Program for drawing graphs under X11
	xv
		Program for displaying bitmaps under X11
	optfir, wfir
		Filter design programs

demo/
	Directory containing pigi and interpreter demos.
doc/
	Documentation for the Ptolemy system (troff sources)
lib/
	interpreter.help
		Interpreter help file
	pigiDebugRpc
		Script used by "pigiDebug" script
	pigiXRes
		X11 resource file used by pigi
	tech4dump/
                Directory used to set pigi colors for screen dumps to
                monochrome printers.
	technology/
		Directory containing "system facets" for pigi
	vem.bindings.7-3
	vem.bindings.8-1
		VEM bindings files for use with pigi
lib.PTARCH/
	interpmain.o
		main() for interpreter
	libddf.a, libsdf.a, libde.a
		Domain-specific support functions
	libptolemy.a
		The "Ptolemy kernel" library
	libpigi.a

makefile
	The top level makefile for Ptolemy -- it builds everything
obj.PTARCH/
	Directory for building the system on a PTARCH architecture.
	It has subdirectories paralleling the subdirectories of src
	and is initially built by MAKEARCH.  That is, it has
	subdirectories domains/, interp/, kernel/, pigiRpc/, preproc/,
	tests/, and xgraph/, and domains/ has subdirectories stars/
	and kernel/.
octtools/
	Contains the parts of the OCT/VEM system required to build
	and run pigi.
	bin.PTARCH/
		Contains binaries for PTARCH.  Currently contains only
		vem.
	include/
		Contains header files needed to build pigiRpc.
	lib.PTARCH/
		Contains OCT libraries needed to build pigiRpc
src/
	Source files and OCT icons for Ptolemy.

Contents of ~ptolemy/src:

compat/
	A set of directories provided to allow Ptolemy to be built
	on systems with different compilers or libraries:

	X11/
		X11 headers for building on systems without them

	cfront/
		include files for building with cfront instead of g++
		(this does not completely work)

domains/
	Domain-specific support:
	ddf/
	de/
	sdf/
	thor/
	cg/
		Support for DDF, DE, SDF, Thor, CG domains (see below)
	Other experimental domains (with the same structure)
	may live here as well.

	makefile
		Makefile for domain support
example/
	Example of how the user can make a customized interpreter
filters/
	Some filter design programs
interp/
	Stuff to build the interpreter with
kernel/
	The Ptolemy kernel sources
libgantt/
	The Gantt chart display library
makefile
	Makefile to build everything
pigiExample/
	How to build your own private pigiRpc (not done yet)
pigilib/
	Sources for pigi support library
pigiRpc/
	makefile and main modules for pigiRpc program
preproc/
	The Ptolemy language preprocessor
xgraph/
	The xgraph program

Each domain (e.g. sdf) has its support in, say, ~ptolemy/domains/sdf.
That directory has the following structure:

demo/
	Pigi demos for the domain
doc/
	Documentation for the domain, with subdirectories:
	demos/
		Documents demos for the domain
	stars/
		Documents stars in the doman.
icons/
	Pigi icons for stars in the domain
kernel/
	Extensions to the kernel to support the domain (sources and
	include files)
makefile
	makefile; makes stuff in kernel/ and stars/
stars/
	Stars that run under the domain.

There are other subdirectories as well:
	.../domains/sdf/image
		Packets for image processing

	.../domains/sdf/expgraph
		"Expanded graph" classes for sophisticated SDF scheduling
		(needs work)

	.../domains/sdf/loopScheduler
		An alternate SDF scheduler

	.../domains/ddf/constructs
		Recognizers for certain "canonical forms" in DDF

	.../domains/thor/pepp
		The "pepp" preprocessor

	.../domains/thor/analyzerX11
		The Thor analyzer

	.../domains/cg/gilsScheduler
		Gil Sih's parallel scheduler

	.../domains/cg/targets
		Multiprocessor targets that use Gil's scheduler
