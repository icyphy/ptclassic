The Ptolemy0.7 release includes more complete documentation of new work in

Significant New Work
--------------------

Further integrations of Tycho into Ptolemy.
     Edward A. Lee, John Reekie, Kevin Chang, Christopher Hylands and many
     others.
        o The Java/Tycho interface, including a Process Networks Sieve of
          Eratosthenes demo.
        o Compilation and dynamic loading of C modules at runtime.
        o Improved preferences manager.
        o An interface that allows the user to jump to C,C++ and Java
          compiler errors.
        o Ptolemy Retargetting Tool.
Finite State Machine (FSM) domain
     Bilung Lee
Synchronous/Reactive (SR) Domain
     Stephen Edwards
Code Generation for the TMS320C50 DSP Domain
     Luis Gutierrez, Brian L. Evans (UT Austin)
Type System Modifications
     Tom Lane (Structured Software Systems), Christopher Hylands, José Luis
     Pino (HP EEsof)
UltraSparc C Code Generation
     William Chen (Columbia University), John Reekie
AcyLoopScheduler
     This scheduler does joint code/data minimization; it generates single
     appearance schedules optimized for buffer memory usage. Very useful in
     code generation, especially in assembly language code generation for
     embedded signal processors which have limited program and data memory.
     Praveen Murthy
HTML documentation of stars.
     ptlang has been modified to create HTML documentation instead of troff
     documentation. A new ptlang keyword named htmldoc has been added to
     ptlang.
     The explanation sections in the Ptolemy builtin stars have been
     converted to htmldoc sections. The HTML star documentation is viewable
     outside Ptolemy and Tycho with a standard HTML viewer. The HTML star
     documentation is also viewable as a hierarchical table of contents with
     Tycho.
     Edward A. Lee, Christopher Hylands


Minor Changes
-------------

Galaxy Recursion Tests
     Compiling recursive galaxies are warned against.
     Tom Lane (Structured Software Systems), Christopher Hylands
New Audio Infrastructure
     New Stars that can use the linear16 audio capabilities of the
     UltraSparc.
     Sunil Bhave, William Chen (Columbia University)
Neural Network Demonstrations
     Demonstrations of logic functions using classical artificial neurons
     and McCulloch-Pitts neurons Biao Lu, Brian L. Evans (The University of
     Texas at Austin)
TychoTarget C Code Generation Target
     The TychoTarget generates output that can be compiled and loaded into
     Tycho. It support creation of customized control panels using Tycho.
     John Reekie, Sunil Bhave
ptcl can handle HOF stars.
     Christopher Hylands
Ptolemy0.7 will use Itcl 2.2, which runs under Tcl 7.6 and Tk4.2.
     The Itcl installation will use shared libraries, where available.
     Christopher Hylands
Ptolemy0.7 can run Matlab on a remote machine
     The PTMATLAB_REMOTE_HOST environment variable if set specifies the name
     of the remote machine. The Ptolemy console (ptcl) command "matlab
     start" supports additional arguments that allows the control from Tcl
     of multiple, distributed Matlab processes.
     Brian Evans (UT Austin), Xavier Warzee (Thomson CSF)
Improved consistency between simulation domains and the CGC domain
     Ptolemy 0.7 has a new Digital Signal Processing (DSP) library in C
     located at $PTOLEMY/src/utils/libptdsp. These routines are used by both
     the simulation and code generation in C domains to provide consistent
     behavior. The DSP functions in the new library include (1) arithmetic
     operations of extended gcd, gcd, lcm, and Smith Form decompositions,
     (2) data conversion operations of PCM Mu law conversion and conversion
     between RGB and YUV color spaces, (3) numeric DSP operations of Fast
     Fourier Transforms, raised cosine functions, sinc functions, and
     windowing functions, and (4) image processing operations such as
     codebook training, histogram, nearest neighbor search, run-length
     coding, and zig-zag scanning.
Implementation cost returned by code generation targets
     The CG56 Simulation target will return the implementation cost of a
     software synthesized for a Motorola 56000 board in terms of program
     size, data size, and execution time. The infrastructure to return
     implementation costs for an entire system or for every block in a
     system now exists in all code generation targets, but returning
     implementation costs is only implemented for the CG56 Simulation
     target.

Cadence Leapfrog VHDL Target
     Xavier Warzee (Thomson CSF), Michael C. Williamson

Backward Compatibility Issues
-----------------------------

Recompilation will be necessary.
     As always, if you upgrade from 0.6 to 0.7, you will need to recompile
     any user designed stars.
Type system changes
     The type system has been changed. Some CGC universes may need explicit
     conversion stars to properly compile.
htmldoc is a new keyword that has been added to ptlang.
     ptlang no longer generates troff output and instead generates html.
Certain CGC DSP stars have been moved.
     To support retargeting demonstrations and galaxies from SDF to CGC,
     Brian L. Evans (UT Austin) moved the CGC stars that implemented DSP
     functions from the cgc/stars directory to the cgc/dsp/stars directory
     and set symbolic links from cgc/icons to cgc/dsp/icons for those stars
     for backwards compatibility. Users should run masters on their own CGC
     demos in order for look-inside to work.
     Affected stars: DTMFPostTest, Dirichlet, FFTCx, FIR, FIRFix, GAL, GGAL,
     Goertzel, GoertzelBase, GoertzelPower, IIR, LMS, LMSOscDet,
     RaisedCosine, Sinc, Window.
The cgc/targets/main directory has been split.
     To separate the uniprocessor and multiprocessor CGC targets, Brian L.
     Evans (UT Austin) split the CGC targets/main directory into
     targets/uniproc and targets/multiproc
Structure of directories under PTOLEMY_SYSTEMS has been changed.
     To support portability between operating systems, Brian L. Evans (UT
     Austin) changed the destination directory in the Ptolemy targets and
     demonstrations to $HOME/PTOLEMY_SYSTEMS/domain. For mixed-domain demos,
     the domain was set to MIXED; otherwise, the domain was set to SDF, CGC,
     etc. Note that $HOME is used instead of ~ because POSIX-compliant Unix
     operating systems always define the HOME environment variable but do
     not always support ~. Also, it is possible to define environment
     variables on Macs and PCs.
Certain audio stars have been removed.
     Sunil Bhave removed the old PCMread/write and SunSound stars from
     ptdesign. Instead you can use the new MonoIn/Out stars, which have been
     added to the cgc palettes. The TkSunSound star has also been removed.

Tentative Release schedule

      Fri, May 7  Ptolemy0.7beta release
      Fri, May 23 Ptolemy0.7 final release.

Delivery Platforms
------------------
We plan on shipping binaries for SunOS4.1.3, Solaris2.5.1 and HPUX10.20. We
will also provide binaries created by offsite users for other platforms.
These binaries will probably include Linux, HPUX9.x, Solaris2.4 and DEC
Alpha.
