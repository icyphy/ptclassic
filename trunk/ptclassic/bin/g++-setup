# Set environment variables to use the the Ptolemy version of g++ and gcc.

# You will need to source this script if you are using the prebuilt
# compiler distributed with Ptolemy _and_ you do not have a link from
# /users/ptolemy to the Ptolemy distribution.  If you have a link, then this
# file should be at /users/ptolemy/bin/g++-setup.

# If dynamic linking fails, then you may need this script.  If you are not
# doing dynamic linking, then you probably need not run this script.

# Don't use this script if you are using a compiler other than the
# compiler distributed with Ptolemy in binary form (pt-*-gnu.$PTARCH.tar.Z)

# If you rebuild Ptolemy with another version of gcc, you will not need
# this script.

# See the Ptolemy Installation guide for more information.
