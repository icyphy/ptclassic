# This script generates a file that references every star referenced
# in a makefile (normally by the PL_SRCS makefile variable).
#
# usage: genStarTable [-vars makefilevars] [domain1 [domain2]]
# If not specified, makefilevars defaults to "PL_SRCS".  It may specify
# more than one makefile variable.
# thor/stars/make.template uses -vars option
#
# Note that this implementation ignores the optional domain1 domain2 args
