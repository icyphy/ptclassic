</h1>

Unlike earlier releases of Ptolemy, Ptolemy 0.7 does not contain a
"What's New" facet, instead we are using a new feature
in Ptolemy 0.7 which allows us to create <A
HREF="minorchanges.html#icons that contain html files">icons that
contain html files</A> such as this file, which can be created from
the
<A
HREF="../init.pal"><CODE>$PTOLEMY/demo/whats_new/init.pal</CODE></A>
palette.

<P>These page is best viewed with Tycho, as it uses extensions to html.
<MENU>
	<LI> Some of the links lead to Ptolemy facets, which a regular
	browser won't know how to handle.
	<LI> Some of the links use environment variables, such
	as <CODE>$PTOLEMY</CODE> or <CODE>$TYCHO</CODE> to link to
	local web pages.
