Changes for 0.6
---------------
src/pigilib/mkIcon.c
        When generating the label for a new icon, we now remove
        the extensions like ".input=2" or "state=value".
        These extensions are totally redundant for ports.
        For state, they might have been useful, but 
        were rarely displayed anyway because the name gets
        too long.

src/pigilib/mkTerm.c
        When a star has more than one input or more than one output,
        we now generate labels for the the terminals.
        These labels, of course, could be put in by hand, but
        they are much easier to remove than to add, and we've had many users
        complain about having to zoom in ridiculously to see which
        port is which.

GenericPort::connect() method
The way the
code in PortHole.cc is written, the method can only be called for
output portholes.  I'm going to re-write the code to work for both
input and output portholes.
