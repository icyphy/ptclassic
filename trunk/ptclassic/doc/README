To print out the entire manual, make sure your .cshrc file has a line like
	setenv PRINTER lw
where "lw" is replaced with the name of your printer.
Then
	% cd ~ptolemy/doc
	% make print

Sorry, but you must have write permission in the ptolemy
directories to do this.  You can either log on as ptolemy (not advised)
or be in the group "ptolemy" (preferred).

The manual currently consists of the following
sections:
	sect 1: general Ptolemy documentation
	sects 2-N: Domain-specific documentation

To print only sect 1, 
	% cd ~ptolemy/doc/main
	% make print

To print only certain pages of sect 1, for example, pages 48 through the end,
	% make OPTIONS=-o48- print
(note that if you print only certain pages, you may generate an incomplete
index file.  To avoid this, be sure your page range includes the last page
of the document. For example, if you want pages 10-12, and page 55 is the
last one, then use the command:
	% make OPTIONS=-o10-12,55- print

To print a subsection of sect 1, such as the pigi chapter,
	% cd ~ptolemy/doc/main/pigi
	% make print

To print an updated index after printing a new subsection
	% cd ~ptolemy/doc
	% make prindex

To print only a domain-specific document, for example sdf,
	% cd ~ptolemy/src/domains/sdf/doc
	% make print
