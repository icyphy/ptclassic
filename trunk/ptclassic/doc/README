To print out the entire manual, make sure your PRINTER environment
variable is set.  If it isn't (if echo $PRINTER says the variable is
undefined) you can type (for csh)

	setenv PRINTER lw
where "lw" is replaced with the name of your printer.

The manual is divided into four volumes: the User's Manual,
Programmer's Manual, Kernel Manual, and Star Atlas.  Each manual is a
collection of postscript files in the directory users_man, prog_man,
kernelManual, or star_atlas.  To print out one of the manuals, cd to
the appropriate directory and then use the "print_manual" command.

For example, to print the User's Manual:

	cd $PTOLEMY/doc/users_man
	print_manual


The directories header and bin are used to print the star
documentation that is automatically generated ptlang.
