# Include postscript (icons) in ditroff output.  This is done by first
# running the Adobe Transcript "psdit" command to convert our ditroff
# input to postscript, and then running a custom postscript post-processor
# on the postscript to include other files.
#
# To do this, we need a custom prolog file for "psdit", which is typically
# in ~ptolemy/lib/psdit.pro.
