<H1>Ptolemy NT Overview</H1>
These pages describe the Ptolemy port to Windows NT4.0.
 <P>
The port is by no means complete.  Currently, under NT4.0 with
<A HREF="http://www.cygnus.com/gnu-win32">Cygnus GNU-win32</A> (version b18)
we can build a <CODE>ptcl</CODE> binary that has the SDF, DE and HOF domains.
 <P>
There are two NT ports: <CODE>nt4</CODE> and <CODE>nt4.vc</CODE>.

<H2><CODE>nt4</CODE></H2>
If the <CODE>PTARCH</CODE> environment variable is set to <CODE>nt4</CODE>,
then we build with Cygnus GNU-win32, which is a port of the GNU tools 
to Windows.  <CODE>nt4</CODE> is easier to port because Cygnus GNU-win32
allows us to use the Unix GNU makefiles in the regular distribution.
 <P>The <CODE>nt4</CODE> port requires that Cygnus GNU-win32 be present.
The port was done with version <CODE>b18</CODE> of GNU-win32.

<H2><CODE>nt4.vc</CODE></H2>
If <CODE>PTARCH</CODE> is set to <CODE>nt4.vc</CODE>, then we use
Microsoft Windows Visual C++ 5.0.  This port relies on using
<CODE>makefile.vc</CODE> files which are MS VC++ versions of the
usually <CODE>makefile</CODE>s.  
 <P> The <CODE>nt4.vc</CODE> port does not yet work, there
are problems creating dlls.

<H2>Questions</H2>
<DL>
<DT> Will these ports work under Windows 95?
<DD> Probably, but they have not been tested.

<DT> What about the <I>XXX</I> domain?  When will that be ported
<DD> At this point, we have no plans to port anything beyond
SDF, DE and HOF.
