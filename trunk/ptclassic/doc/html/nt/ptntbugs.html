<h2><a name="tar">Tar and Zip File Bugs</a></h2>
<menu>
<li> When you unzip the zip file, you may see messages about
files being overwritten.  These messages are probably caused
by symbolic links in the original source directory or by two filenames differing only by case.  You can safely 
overwrite these files.

<li> Cygwin32 tar has problems creating <CODE>$PTOLEMY/colors/ptolemy/con</CODE>.  The problem is that <CODE>con</CODE> is a reserved name.
 <br>The Cygwin32 FAQ says
<BLOCKQUOTE>
DOS special filenames

Files cannot be named com1, lpt1, or aux (to name a few); either as
the root filename or as the extension part. If you do, you'll have
trouble. Unix programs don't avoid these names which can make things
interesting. Eg, the perl distribution has a file called aux.sh. The
perl configuration tries to make sure that aux.sh is there, but an
operation on a file with the magic letters 'aux' in it will hang.

</BLOCKQUOTE>
You can replicate this with:
<pre>
bash-2.01$ cd /tmp
bash-2.01$ mkdir con
mkdir: cannot make directory `con': Permission denied
bash-2.01$ mkdir foo
bash-2.01$
</pre>
The workaround is to use a non GNU tar tool such as Winzip.

<li>  Below is some information about
<a name="mkgroup"><CODE>mkgroup</CODE></a>
from Tim Kurzweg <CODE>&lt;tim@ee.pitt.edu&gt;</CODE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Note: We noticed that when creating the group
file, this procedure isn't always perfect.  You should check to make
sure that users are in the right groups.  

<p>i.e. If someone should have administrative rights and the
administrator group or Domain Administrator group in the <B>group</B>
file says the group number is "512", the user's second number after
their name in the passwd file should be "512".

<p> It is important that the account which you are currently using
have administrative rights so that you can install software onto the
disk.  If not, you should change the group/passwd files so that you do
have administrative rights or log out and then log back in using an
account that does and is setup correctly in the group/passwd files.

<p>Since this may be confusing, an example would seem necessary.
As I perform the above steps on my computer, here is my <B>/etc/group</B> file:

<pre>
Domain Admins::512:
Domain Guests::514:
Domain Users::513:
Levitan's VLSI::1036:
MailServer-group::1039:
SIGDA People::1004:
None::513:
Everyone::0:
</pre>


 <p>My machine participates in a Windows NT Domain and all groups
listed above are from the Domain Controller.  Notice that the number
after "Domain Admins" is "512".  This is the number that identifies
this group.  If you are only using accounts from your local machine,
you should look for the "Administrators" group and its identification
number.  Next look at my <B>/etc/passwd</B> file:

<pre>
Administrator::500:513:::/bin/sh
eric::1002:513:Eric N. Reiss::/bin/sh
eric2::1014:513:Eric2::/bin/sh
Guest::501:514:::/bin/sh
IUSR_JAMAICA::1001:513:Internet Guest Account::/bin/sh
kathy::1007:513:Kathy Preas::/bin/sh
MailServer-user::1038:513:MailServer-user::/bin/sh
Mcdonald::1037:513:Eric McDonald::/bin/sh
mcgahey::1033:512:Bill McGahey::/bin/sh
plusquellic::1034:513:Jim Plusquellic::/bin/sh
rajon::1032:513:Rajon Gilmore::/bin/sh
sigda::1003:513:Sigda Personnel::/bin/sh
steve::1011:513:Steven Levitan::/bin/sh
web-server::1017:513:Netscape Web Server::/bin/sh
webadmin::1020:513:webadmin::/bin/sh
Administrator::500:513:::/bin/sh
Guest::501:513:::/bin/sh
Administrators::544:0:::
Backup Operators::551:0:::
Guests::546:0:::
Power Users::547:0:::
Replicator::552:0:::
Users::545:0:::
</pre>



Now, even though I used both the -d and -l switches to get the
accounts above, a problem has occured.  All of the accounts listed at
the top of the <B>passwd</B> file have "513" as the second number
after their username except for the user with username "mcgahey", who
has group id number "512".  This is wrong since a number of the users
above have "Domain Admins" privileges including me with the account
"eric".  So before I go any further, I am going to change the "513" on
the line with the username "eric" so that it says "512".  Since I am
currently logged in as "eric", I shouldn't have any permission
problems after the change.

 <p>If you are using just local accounts, then get the group id number for the 
group "administrator" out of the <B>/etc/group</B> file and make sure you 
have that number for the account you are using to install everything with.

Note: If you are logged into your machine using a Domain account and
you run <B>mkpasswd</B> and <B>mkgroup</B> with just <B>-l</B>, you
may not get an "administrator" group.  You should be logged into the
machine directly to run with the <B>-l</B> switch.

<h2>Compilation bugs</h2>
<MENU>

<li> The Microsoft Visual C++ port (<CODE>PTARCH == nt4.vc</CODE>)
is unlikely to build and has not been tested.

<li> Compiling with Cygwin32 is slow.  This is because Cygwin32
adds a layer to file access and other operations.

<li> Linking pigiRpc and ptcl can take a long time.
This is mostly due to the fact that the Cygwin port is using
static libraries.  Compiling without debugging (<CODE>-g</CODE>) 
might help

<li> <CODE>make</CODE> fails with
<pre>
making install in kernel
../../mk/compile.mk:95: *** missing separator.  Stop.
</pre>
You should only see this error if you are building from sources
0.7.2devel created before 2/22/99.
In versions of Ptolemy 0.7.2devel before 2/22/99, the makefiles
referred to the library being built with the <CODE>LIB</CODE>
makefile variable, which was overridden by the <CODE>LIB</CODE>
environment variable.  The fix was to 
be sure that you do not have the <CODE>LIB</CODE> environment
variable set in bash.  Try typing:
<CODE>unset LIB</CODE>

<li> <CODE>make</CODE> failed with
<pre>
c:/tycho0.3.devel/mk/tycommon.mk:276: *** target pattern contains no `%'.
</pre>
<p>The problem here was that <CODE>ROOT</CODE> was set to
<CODE>c:/tycho0.3devel</CODE>.  The colon was being interpreted by
<CODE>make</CODE>, so setting <CODE>ROOT</CODE> to <CODE>/tycho0.3devel</CODE>
fixed the problem.
 <p>

<li> <CODE>make</CODE> failed with:
<pre>
'\\carson\cxh\pt\obj.nt4\pigiRpc' is an invalid current directory
path.  UNC paths are not supported.  Defaulting to Windows directory.
The handle could not be duplicated during a pipe operation.
</pre>
<p> The fix is to run <CODE>make --unix</CODE>, or do
<pre>
MAKE_MODE=unix
export MAKE_MODE
</pre>

<li> Some of the tests in
<a href="../../src/octtools/Packages/oct"><CODE>$PTOLEMY/src/octtools/Packages/oct</CODE></a> fail.


<li> If tcltk gets a message about cross compiling, 
Be sure that the system control panel includes the directory that
contains gcc.  or try:
<pre>
cd $PTOLEMY/src/tcltk
make CC="/cygnus/cygwin-b20/H-i586-cygwin32/bin/gcc -v"
</pre>
The problem seems to be that <CODE>/bin/sh.exe</CODE> can't find
<CODE>gcc</CODE> <CODE>make SHELL=bash</CODE> also works


<li> Compiling <CODE>octtools/tkoct/top</CODE> fails.
The top library is use only by the <CODE>oct2ptcl</CODE> binary, which
is used to convert Oct facets to ptcl scripts.  If you don't need
<CODE>oct2ptcl</CODE>, then you can ignore this error and move on.

<li> <a name="xpackages"><CODE>octtools/Xpackages/iv</CODE> fails to compile</a>

<pre>
../../../../src/octtools/Xpackages/iv/ivGetLine.c: In function `ivTextInit':
../../../../src/octtools/Xpackages/iv/ivGetLine.c:98: storage size of `tty'

identifier is reported only once
../../../../src/octtools/Xpackages/iv/ivGetLine.c:100: for each function it
appears in.)
</pre>
There are also problems compiling <CODE>timer.c</CODE>

 <p>The <CODE>iv</CODE> package is used to change values of variables
interactively.  I believe that these errors can be ignored, <CODE>iv</CODE>
is not used in <CODE>vem</CODE> or <CODE>pigiRpc</CODE>
(Reported by
Sascha Schwarz <CODE>&lt;s_schwa@informatik.uni-kl.de&gt;</CODE>).


<li> Problems compiling <CODE>octtools/attache/io.c</CODE>:
<pre>
../../../src/octtools/attache/io.c:39: curses.h: No such file or directory
</pre>
<CODE>attache</CODE> is used to edit Octtools facets by hand.
Most users never need this functionality, so you can probably skip
this error and move on.  <CODE>curses.h</CODE> is the include
file for the curses system, which is a cursor based ascii windowing
package.  To fix this bug, it would be necessary to find
a Cygwin32 curses library and .h file.

Sascha Schwarz <CODE>&lt;s_schwa@informatik.uni-kl.de&gt;</CODE>).



<li> <a name="xv"><CODE>xv</CODE> fails to compile</a>
There are various problems compiling xv under Cygwin.
In the short term, you can ignore them.  The SDF image processing
demos use xv.
 <p>Eric Pauer reported that there is a precompiled version of 
xv at:
<a href="ftp://linc.cis.upenn.edu/pub/xv/xv-3.10.NTbin.tar.gz"><CODE>ftp://linc.cis.upenn.edu/pub/xv/xv-3.10.NTbin.tar.gz</CODE></a>

<li> Problems compiling <CODE>src/tysh/SigHandle.cc</CODE>:
<pre>
../../src/tysh/SigHandle.cc: In function `int setHandlers(void (*)(int))':
../../src/tysh/SigHandle.cc:109: `SIGIOT' undeclared (first use this
function)
</pre>
The <CODE>tysh</CODE> binary is used when <CODE>tycho -pigi</CODE>
is started up.  In the short term, this error can be ignored.

The code in <CODE>SigHandle.cc</CODE>, is used to catch signals so
that we can attempt to save files etc.  This code never really worked
well, and is basically dead code.

 <p>The quick and dirty thing to do would be to just ifdef out those lines.

 <p>I think we could use <CODE>SIGABRT</CODE> instead of
<CODE>SIGIOT</CODE>.  Under Solaris, and egcs-1.0.2,
<CODE>SIGIOT</CODE> and <CODE>SIGABRT</CODE> are both defined as the
number 6.
 <p>Below is a sample code fragment that is unlikely to break other ports.
<pre>
    // Under Cygwin32, SIGIOT is not defined
#ifdef SIGIOT
    if (ptSignal(SIGIOT, sigHandler) != 0) {
        return 5;
    }
#else
    if (ptSignal(SIGABRT, sigHandler) != 0) {
        return 5;
    }
#endif

    if [catch {set retval [::tycho::HTMLDocSys::generateHTML $verbose $debug \

<h2>Problems Starting Ptolemy</h2>
<menu>

<li> <CODE>$PTOLEMY/bin/pigi</CODE> prints warning messages about
not being able to find <CODE>xrdb</CODE>.  This is because
<CODE>/bin/sh.exe</CODE> does not have a working <CODE>type</CODE>
command.  One workaround would be to copy <CODE>bash.exe</CODE>
to <CODE>/bin/sh.exe</CODE>, though this will result in slower compiles.

<li> Starting up <CODE>pigi</CODE> results in messages like:
<pre>
Error: Unable to load ptk startup file: :

"package require tycho.kernel.basic"
    (file "C:\tycho0.3devel/kernel/Tycho.tcl" line 255)
    invoked from within
"source $path/kernel/Tycho.tcl"
</pre>
This message can occur if you have a standalone installation of 
Tycho installed.  The workaround is to unset TYCHO before starting pigi:
<pre>
unset TYCHO
pigi
</pre>

<li> If you see the following message, then you may need to 
upgrade to Cygwinb19.1 or later
<pre>
RPC Error: can not fdopen for write in application

<li> Locally we use Hummingbird's Exceed X server.  Sascha Schwarz
<CODE>&lt;s_schwa@informatik.uni-kl.de&gt;</CODE>, reported font
problems with the MicroImages X server that were solved by using
Exceed.  If you have font problems, you might try the following:

	<ol>
	<li> Be sure that another X client starts up before starting
	<CODE>pigi</CODE>.  The <CODE>pigi</CODE> script attempts
	to start <CODE>xclock</CODE> by hand if <CODE>xrdb -query</CODE>
	return no resources.  Be sure that <CODE>pigi</CODE>
	successfully starts <CODE>xclock</CODE>, or start it
	by hand before running <CODE>pigi</CODE>

	<li> Add the following line to your <CODE>.Xdefaults</CODE>
	file:
	<pre>
	Vem.label.fonts: 9x15
	</pre>
	then do <CODE>xrdb -merge ~/.Xdefaults</CODE>
	</ol>


<li> Under NT4.0, with Exceed 6.1, the following messages may occur:

<pre>
A Serious X Error has occurred:
   BadValue (integer parameter out of range for operation)
   Request X_QueryColors (minor code 0)
Type 'y' to continue, 'n' to exit, 'a' to abort:

The workaround is to be sure that your display is set to 256

<h2>Problems Running Ptolemy</h2>
<MENU>

<li> If you have problems with <CODE>pxgraph</CODE>, see
the <a href="ptntinstall.html#pxgraph">Ptolemy NT Installation page</a>,
and <a href="../../../src/pxgraph/README.txt"><CODE>$PTOLEMY/src/pxgraph/README.txt</CODE></a>

<li> The SDF Butterfly demo gives a bogus graph
The problem here is that the temporary plot data files were not
being opened in binary mode, so they were being truncated.
 <p>The file to change is <CODE>src/kernel/Display.cc</CODE>.
The change to make is to change:
<pre>
 	    if ((strm[i] = fopen(tmpFileNames[i], "w")) == NULL) {
</pre>
To
<pre>
 	    if ((strm[i] = fopen(tmpFileNames[i], "wb")) == NULL) {
</pre>

<li> The Matlab and Mathematica stars do not work.

<li> The SDF Gaussian demo fails with:
<pre>
Error: no interpreter to evaluate 'expr 1024/8'
</pre>
This message comes from <CODE>kernel/InvokeInterp.cc</CODE>:
<pre>
// send a string to an external interpreter for evaluation
const char*
InvokeInterp :: interpreter(const char* expression) {
    Error::error("no interpreter to evaluate '", expression, "'.");
    return NULL;
}
</pre>
The problem here is that there are multiple
definitions of this method in the kernel, pigilib and ptcl.

 <p>Wolfgang Reimer created a patch that solves this problem, see:
<a href="http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/pt0.7.1/ptolemy0.7.1/html/reimer0898/pt0.7.1p1.ptclInvokeInterp.patch.gz"><CODE>http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/pt0.7.1/ptolemy0.7.1/html/reimer0898/pt0.7.1p1.ptclInvokeInterp.patch.gz</CODE></a>


<li> <a name="Loadingastarfails">Loading a star fails</a>
Currently, dynamically loading a star is not supported under NT,
but Ptolemy 0.7.1 was not even getting that far, pigi was
failing to run <CODE>ptlang</CODE>

 <p>To replicate the bug:
<ol>

<li>  I have a .pl file, but no .cc or .h file

<li> I hit '*'

<li> The Make Star window comes up.

<li> I fill in the Star name and Star src dir,

<li> I hit ok.

<li> I get a message:
<pre>
   Loader: cd //d/users/cxh/c++/pt; ptlang SDFMyRamp.pl >&
   /tmp/pt2af3001
   Can't open error file
</pre>

</ol>


I looked in
<CODE>pigilib/pigiLoader.cc</CODE> and found that the ptlang call
actually was calling <CODE>util_cystem()</CODE>.

<CODE>util_csystem()</CODE>
 is defined in
<CODE>src/octtools/Packages/utility/csystem.c</CODE>

The bug is that util_cystem() execs /bin/csh, which does not
exist under Cygwin

As a hack, I modified util_cystem so that we call /bin/bash:
<pre>
#ifdef PTNT
        /* /bin/sh needs to actually be /bin/bash */
	(void) execl("/bin/bash", "bash", "-c", s, 0);
#else
	(void) execl("/bin/csh", "csh", "-f", "-c", s, 0);
#endif
</pre>


 <p>I then rebuilt the octtools libutility and pigi
I then copied bash.exe from the Cygwin directory to /bin

 <p>The above change is in <CODE>0.7.2devel</CODE>.
Note that to get it to work, you need to copy
<CODE>bash.exe</CODE> to <CODE>/bin/bash/exe</CODE>

 <p><CODE>util_csystem()</CODE>
 is also used to compile the star by hand from within
<CODE>pigiLoader.cc</CODE>
 or to run make if a makefile is present.

 <p>Sascha Schwarz
<CODE>&lt;s_schwa@informatik.uni-kl.de&gt;</CODE> reported
the following workaround for this problem
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The clue is to create the .pl file, and then copy some schematic from
somewhere in the same directory, and name it in the same way. E.g., DEFoo.pl
would require schematics foo, contents don't seem to matter. Then you can
compile your own pigiRPC as described in the Programmer's Guide, p.1-7. Then
run this pigi-version, and you will be able to make the star using the '*'
command, though you might have some error messages. But the second or third
try usually works. 
</BLOCKQUOTE>


<li> Incremental linking still fails
<pre>
    Error: Error in creating shared object, command failed: g++ -shared -o
    /tmp/__ptlink1032_2.so /usr/cxh/src/pt/SDFMyRamp.o
</pre>
In brief, the problem is that incremental linking of user stars is
broken in the NT port.  In the past, I've tried to build a shared
library version of Ptolemy under NT, but had various problems
with the constructors etc.

 <p>The alternative to building a shared library version is to build
a static version of pigiRpc, which is what is currently built under
NT.  The problem with a static pigiRpc is that incremental linking is
tricky.  We had it working under SunOS years ago with the BSD ld -a flag,
but it looks like that is not supported  

 <p>The binutils2-9.1/ld/TODO file says:
<pre>
Support the "traditional" BSD  -A flag (incremental loading).
(There is a -A flag in ld now, but it is used to specify the
architecture.  That should probably be changed.)
</pre>

 <p>One workaround would be to avoid incrementally linking your stars
and instead build a pigiRpc that had the stars built in.  The way
to do this is to create a makefile for your stars, build a library
and then modify $PTOLEMY/mk/stars.mk so that your stars are built in.
The programmer's manual has some info about this, see also
$PTOLEMY/src/pigiExample

<li> Tk demos don't run 
 <p>Formerly, 
running the SDF butterfly demo within pigi
takes roughly 60 seconds, but running it from within ptcl takes roughly
2 seconds.
 <p>The problem is that early releases of Cygwin32 did not
have itimers, so pigi's event loop uses a much slower technique.
<CODE>config-nt4.mk</CODE> defined <CODE>PT_NO_TIMER</CODE>, which 
is used in <CODE>src/ProfileTimer.cc</CODE> and
<CODE>src/SimControl.cc</CODE>.  However, Cygwin20 has itimers
so we removed the <CODE>-DPT_NO_TIMER</CODE> from 
<CODE>config-nt4.mk</CODE>, and the butterfly demo is much faster.
 <p>Now, if we use itimers, then 
the problem is that the Tk demos hang. The workaround
is to either edit <CODE>config-nt4.mk</CODE> and add the 
<CODE>-DPT_NO_TIMER</CODE> flag and recompile, or to do the following:
<pre>
cd $PTOLEMY/obj.nt4/kernel
rm SimControl.o ProfileTimer.o
make USERFLAGS=-DPT_NO_TIMER install
cd ../pigiRpc
make install
</pre>
Currently, in 0.7.2devel, the itimers are not used, so
the butterfly demo is slow, but at least the Tk demos run.
