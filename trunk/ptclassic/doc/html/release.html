<h3><a name="changes">Changes between 0.7.1p1 and 0.7.2devel</a></h3>

The 0.7.2devel release includes changes for the Adaptive Computing
System domain developed by Eric Pauer's group at Sanders, A
Lockheed-Martin Corporatio.

 <p>This release also provides support for
Itcl3.0.1/Tcl8.0.4/Tk8.0.4.  Ptolemy 0.7.1p1 used Itcl2.2/Tcl7.6/Tk4.2.
	
 <p>Most of the Itcl 3.0 changes are in Tycho.  

 <p>In addition, Ptolemy 0.7.2devel provides better support for the NT
platform.

<menu>
<li> Changes to the FSM domain to support the valued FSM syntax (Bilung Lee)

<li> Pxgraph has been upgraded to Ptplot 2.0, which includes support
  for the AWT 1.1 event model and many code cleanups.
	

<li> The GNU tools have been upgraded to
	 <br>gcc-2.95.1
	 <br>make-3.77


<li> The HP only GNU tools have been upgraded to:
         <br>binutils-2.9.1
	 <br>bison-1.28
	 <br>flex-2.5.4

<li> Windows NT4.0 support is more complete, 0.7.2devel support building under
  Cygwin32 b20.1
  See <a href="nt"><CODE>$PTOLEMY/doc/html/nt</CODE></a> or
  <a href="http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cxh/ptpub/nt/index.html"><CODE>http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cxh/ptpub/nt/index.html</CODE></a>


<li> Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 can be used to compile ptcl.ptiny, which
  includes most of the SDF and DE domains.  This port is included for
  demonstration purposes only.  In theory, it should be possible to
  compile all of Ptolemy under MSVC++ 6.0, though we have not tried.
  See $PTOLEMY/mk/config-nt4.vc.mk.vc

</menu>

<h3><a name="compatibility">0.7.1 and 0.7.2devel Compatibility</a></h3>
<menu>
<li> The NT platform has problems with filenames that contain
<CODE>%</CODE> and files or directories named <CODE>con</CODE>.
As a result, we had to rename several directories under
<CODE>$PTOLEMY/lib</CODE> and then run <CODE>ptfixtree</CODE>
on the entire Ptolemy tree to adjust for these changes.
If you have any custom Ptolemy facets, you will need to run
<CODE>$PTOLEMY/bin/ptfixtree</CODE> on your facets so that
your facets will be able to find the newly renamed files.

 <br>The script <CODE>$PTOLEMY/bin/fixntpaths</CODE> is what we used
to rename the files.  <CODE>$PTOLEMY/bin/ptfixtree.tcl</CODE>
was modifies so that the changes we made are automatically loaded.

<li> A major feature of Ptolemy 0.7.2devel is that Itcl was upgraded from
Itcl 2.2 to Itcl3.0.  Any stars that use Tcl or Tk will definitely need to
be recompiled.  

 <br>We are not that confident of the Tycho part of the port to Tcl8.0.  The
main problem seems to be in menu traversals, though there are problems
with search and replace as well.  It is usable with Ptolemy, but it is
not very polished.  This could present a problem to you, depending on
how much you are using Tycho in your product.  You might be better off
sticking with Itcl2.2

 <br>Between Itcl2.2 and Itcl3.0, the directory structure changed, so I've
made changes to 0.7.2devel to reflect that change.  The biggest changes
are that
 <br>$PTOLEMY/tcltk/itcl is now $PTOLEMY/tcltk/tcl
$PTOLEMY/tcltk/tcl.$PTARCH is now $PTOLEMY/tcltk/tcl.$PTARCH

 <br>The location of the libraries in the subdirectories has also changed. 

 <br>As a result, many of the scripts in $PTOLEMY/bin and the makefiles in 
$PTOLEMY/mk have changed.

 <br>We could have probably forced Itcl3.0 to install in the same
directories as Itcl2.2, but it would have required rewriting some
of the makefiles that ship with Itcl/Tcl/Tk.

 <br>There were a few changes in the code itself, but we left those #defined
so that Itcl2.2 should be usable without too many changes.

 <br>The version of Tycho that is shipped with 0.7.2devel is 
not at all backward compatible with Itcl2.2.  To use Itcl2.2, it would
be best to drop in the version of Tycho that shipped with 
Ptolemy 0.7.1p1

<li> Ptolemy 0.7.2devel also includes
an upgrade of the compiler from egcs-1.0.2 to gcc-2.95.1
In general, <CODE>.o</CODE> files built under Ptolemy 0.7
will need to be recompiled for use with Ptolemy 0.7.2deel


<li> The Synchronous Reactive Itcl stars have been removed in 0.7.2devel.
The problem is that the changes to Itcl are sufficiently complex that
a complete rewrite of these stars would be necessary.

</menu>

<h3><a name="#bugs">Bugs</a></h3>
<menu>
<li> Some of the Code Generation domains have not been tested, so
they have been moved off the main palette. 

<li> We have not tested the interface to Mathematica.

<li> Under Solaris 2.5.1 with Sun CC 4.2, binaries built with
VIS do not start up, the binaries are apparently invalid.
This is likely a loader (ld) problem.

<li> The Matlab interface has not been tested with recent releases
of Matlab.  The Matlab interface worked for us under
Solaris2.5.1 with Matlab 5.2.  The most recent release is Matlab 5.3.

</menu>

<h3><a name="egcs">gcc-2.8 and gcc-2.95.1</a></h3>

Ptolemy 0.7.2devel should compile with gcc-2.7.2.2, but the default
compiler we build the binaries with is gcc-2.95.1  

 <p> Note that under gcc-2.8.2,
compiling with -O -fPIC causes an internal compiler error when
compiling <CODE>Block.cc</CODE>, so we are shipping with gcc-2.95.1


 <p>For more information about egcs, see
<A HREF="http://egcs.com/egcs/"><CODE>http:/egcs.cygnus.com</CODE></A>.

 <p>The most common problem with using egcs is that
<CODE>libg++</CODE> is no longer used, so certain include files, such
as <CODE>std.h</CODE> are not found at compile time 
and certain symbols, such as
<CODE>ACG::ACG(unsigned int, int)</CODE> are missing at link time.
 <p>Usually, doing a <CODE>make clean; make install</CODE> 
will solve the problem. 
 <p>The way we work around this is by defining <CODE>-DPT_EGCS</CODE>
in <CODE>config-egcs.mk</CODE> and then including that makefile
in the <CODE>config-<I>$PTARCH</I>.mk</CODE> file instead of
<CODE>config-g++.mk</CODE>.

 <p>Note that egcs does not need <CODE>libg++</CODE>, so the
<CODE>SYSLIBS</CODE> makefile variable is set to not include
<CODE>-lg++</CODE>

<h3><a name="ptclwithtk">Ptcl with Tk</a></h3>
Olaf Lenzmann provided patches to Ptolemy that allow ptcl to be used
with Tk. This functionality is experimental, and primarily for use
with the Microsoft Visual C++ port.
<ol>
<li> Recompile <CODE>src/kernel/Star.cc</CODE> so that the Tk
event loop is called from within Star::run()

<pre>
cd $PTOLEMY/obj.$PTARCH/kernel
rm -f Star.o
make USERFLAGS="-DPT_PTCL_WITH_TK -I$PTOLEMY/tcltk/tcl/include -I/usr/openwin/include" install
</pre>


<li> Create the following <CODE>override.mk</CODE> file
as <CODE>$PTOLEMY/obj.$PTARCH/ptcl/override.mk</CODE>
 <br>
<pre>
# Override.mk file to create a Ptcl with Tk binary.
# You may need to modify the /usr/openwin/include path
# to point to your X11 include files
GPP_FLAGS += -DPT_PTCL_WITH_TK -I../../src/ptklib -I$PTOLEMY/tcltk/tcl/include -I/usr/openwin/include"
PTCL_WITH_TK = 1
TK = 1
# If you are building under Unix,
# copy src/tcltk/tk8.0.5pt/generic/tkConsole.c to src/ptcl and then
# uncomment the next two lines:
#LIBS += tkConsole.o
#LIBFILES += tkConsole.o
</pre>


<li> Rebuild ptcl
<pre>
cd $PTOLEMY/obj.$PTARCH/ptcl
make clean
make
</pre>

</ol>





<h3><a name="pxgraph">Pxgraph</a></h3>
Pxgraph has been converted to Java.  See
the troubleshooting guide at
<a href="http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/java/ptolemy.plot2.0/ptolemy/plot/doc/internals/troubleshooting.html"><CODE>$PTOLEMY/tycho/java/ptolemy/plot/doc/internals/troubleshooting.html</CODE></a>

If you don't have Java, see
<a href="ftp://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/pub/misc/xgraph/index.html"><CODE>ftp://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/pub/misc/xgraph/index.html</CODE></a>
for pxgraph X11 binaries and sources.  See
<a href="pxgraph.README.txt"><CODE>$PTOLEMY/src/pxgraph/README.txt</CODE></a> for details.

 <p>To run the Java version of pxgraph, you must do one of the following:
<ol>
<li> Set the <CODE>JAVAHOME</CODE> environment variable to point
to the directory where the Java Development Kit is installed.
For example, your <CODE>.cshrc</CODE> might contain
<pre>
setenv JAVAHOME /opt/jdk1.1.7B
</pre>

<li> If you do not set <CODE>JAVAHOME</CODE>, then the pxgraph
script will search your path for the <CODE>javac</CODE> binary.
If <CODE>javac</CODE> is found, then the directory above it
is used for the value of <CODE>JAVAHOME</CODE>

<li> You can also edit <CODE>$PTOLEMY/bin/pxgraph</CODE> directly
and adjust the <CODE>JAVADEFAULT</CODE> variable.
</ol>

	* src/demos/rolodex:
	Removed this Itcl demo, SRItcl stars don't work with Itcl3.0
	
	* src/domains/sr/stars/SRConst.pl:
	Add functionality to emit constant in every "interval" instants. 
	(Bilung Lee)

	port (Olaf Lenzmann)

	* src/kernel/isa.h:
	nt4.vc: ptcl starts up, but there are no commands
	The fix is to edit isa.h and modify the quote macro to 
	use the ansi cpp syntax:

	* src/kernel/miscFuncs.h
	nt4.vc: DERealTimeStar.cc fails to compile, the fix
	The fix is to modify miscFuncs.h so that when we include
	stdlib.h, we undef min and max

	* src/kernel/miscFuncs.cc
	Increase the size of the tempFileName buffer
	nt4vc: Read the TEMP variable to determine what directory to use
	(Olaf Lenzmann)

        * src/kernel/paths.cc:
	ptcl.ptiny fails to start with messages about not being able
	to find the binary.
	The fix is to modify kernel/paths.cc so it searches for backslashes
	under nt4.vc
	However, a problem persists unless we call ptcl.ptiny.exe.
	This is because pathSearch does not look for .exe files

	* src/pxgraph/README.txt:
	Added message about running the X11 pxgraph from the Java version

	Change define of EXTERN to OCT_EXTERN for Tcl8.x
	
	* src/octtools/tkoct/top/tclMain.c:
	Tcl8.0
	* src/octtools/tkoct/top/memCore.c:
	nt4: Added extern for end
	
	* src/octtools/tkoct/oct2ptcl/make.template:
	nt4: use BINARY_EXT

	* src/octtools/tkoct/oct2ptcl/oct2ptcl.c:
	In Ptolemy 0.7.1 and earlier, some of the facets in
	$PTOLEMY/lib/ptolemy had the % character in their names, which
	causes no end of trouble under NT4.0 with Cygwin 20.1.
	In Ptolemy 0.7.1 and later, we changed the name of these
	files and substituted in the string "percent" for the character
	"%".

	* src/octtools/vem/utility/colors.c:
	vuWhite(): Don't call WhitePixel here, instead, get the color
	by name. The value for WhitePixel apparently is the value for
	the default colormap.  If we have a TrueColor map, then the
	value of WhitePixel will be out of range if we use it with
	a PseudoColor map

	* src/octtools/lib/make.template:
	Don't install the 'Vem' file, we don't use it anyway, and it
	causes problems when extracting the tar files under NT
