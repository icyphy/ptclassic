Currently, we have four domains in \*(PT : SDF, DE, DDF, CAPSIM.
These domains can be mixed arbitrarily to compose a complicated
system.  Any 
.c Wormhole
may contain other
.c Wormhole s
to make a hierarchical structure.
A couple of domains are to be added in the near future : THOR, MQ.
Currently, the DE domain only is timed.  After the THOR domain
is incorporated, our scheme of timing management will be rigorously
tested.  The timed nature of the SDF domain has proven to be
well behaved with the DE domain.
