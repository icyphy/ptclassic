.H1 "Getting Started
.pp
To get started, just make sure
.i ~ptolemy/bin
and
.i ~ptolemy/bin.sunX
(where the X is a 3 if you are on a Sun-3, and 4 if you are on a Sun-4)
are in your PATH and type
.c interpreter
to invoke the Ptolemy interpreter.
.pp
As a more advanced user, you will probably want to
write some of your own
.c Star s,
so you will have to get a local working directory
set up and properly linked to the centralized directories where
\*(PT is installed.
If you want to do this, see the directory
.c ~ptolemy/src/example
for an example of this
and the README file in that directory for instructions on how to
set this up.
