To get started, just make sure
.i ~ptolemy/bin
and
.i ~ptolemy/bin.ARCH
are in your PATH
(where
.i ARCH
is replaced by ``sun3'' if you are on a Sun-3, ``sun4'' if you are on a Sun-4,
``vax'' if you are on a Vax, or ``mips'' if you are on a DecStation based
on the MIPS architecture).
.IE path
Now type
.c interpreter
to invoke the Ptolemy interpreter.  It is also possible to specify a file
of interpreter commands as a command line argument; see the section ``Loading
Commands from a File'' for details.
.pp
As a more advanced user, you will probably want to
write some of your own
.c Star s,
so you will have to get a local working directory
set up and properly linked to the centralized directories where
\*(PT is installed.
If you want to do this, see the directory
.c ~ptolemy/src/example
for an example of this
and the README file in that directory for instructions on how to
set this up.  As an alternative, you can use the interpreter's
.c link
command to incrementally link in your own stars; this feature
may not always be powerful enough to do what you want.
