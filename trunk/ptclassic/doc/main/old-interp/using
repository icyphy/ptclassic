.H1 "Using the Interpreter
.pp
There are two ways to use \*(PT: an
.i interpreter
and a
.i "graphical user interface" .
The interpreter conveniently operates on dumb terminals and
other environments where graphical user interfaces may not be
available, and is described in this section.
The graphical user interface is described in a separate section.
.pp
The \*(PT interpreter accepts input from the keyboard, or from
a file, or some combination thereof.
It allows the user to set up a new simulation by creating instances of
.c Star s,
connecting them together, setting the initial value of internal
parameters and states, running the simulation, restarting it, etc.
The
interpreter has a Lisp-like syntax; all commands are of the
form
.(c
(verb arguments)
.)c
The interpreter has a
.i "known list"
containing all the classes of
.c Star s
and
.c Galaxy s
it currently knows about.
It is possible to add a new
.c Star
to the known list at runtime only by using the incremental linking
facility, but this has restrictions, see the
.c link
command below (you can also make your own copy of the
interpreter with your own
.c Star s
linked in).  However, it's
straightforward to add new classes of
.c Galaxy s
to the known list.
.pp
The interpreter also has a
.i "current galaxy" .
Normally, this is
.c mainGalaxy .
During the execution of a
.c defgalaxy
command, however, the current galaxy
is the one being defined, not the
.c mainGalaxy .
.pp
This description of commands is current for version 2.2 of
the interpreter \(em commands are being added all the time.
.H2 "Commands for Defining the Simulation"
.pp
This section describes commands that build the
simulation, adding
.c Star s,
.c Galaxy s,
.c State s,
and connections among them.
.H3 "Setting the Domain"
.pp
.IE "domain command"
\*(PT supports multiple simulation domains, and so does the \*(PT
interpreter.  Before creating a simulation environment and running
it, it is necessary to establish the domain.  Currently, three domains
are linked into the standard interpreter:
synchronous data flow (SDF), discrete event (DE), and
dynamic data flow (DDF).
The interpreter has a
.i "current domain" ;
this is initially
.c SDF .
The command
.(c
(domain \fIdomain-name\fP)
.)c
changes the current domain; it is only legal when the current galaxy
is empty.  The argument must be the name of a known domain (currently
.c SDF ,
.c DDF ,
or
.c DE ).
The command
.(c
(domain)
.)c
displays the current domain.  It is possible to create
.c Wormhole s
\- interfaces between domains \- by including a
.c domain
command inside a galaxy definition.
.H3 "Creating Instances of Stars and Galaxys
.pp
The first step in any simulation is to define the blocks
(
.c Star s
and
.c Galaxy s)
to be used in the simulation.
The command
.(c
(star \fIname class\fP)
.)c
.IE "star command"
creates a new instance of a
.c Star
or
.c Galaxy
of class
.i class ,
names it
.i name ,
and inserts it into the current galaxy.
Any
.c State s
in the
.c Star
(or
.c Galaxy )
are created with their default values.
While it is not enforced, the normal naming convention is that
.i name
begin with a lower case letter and
.i class
begin with an upper case letter
(this makes it easy to distinguish instances of a
.c class
from the
.c class
itself).
The synonym
.(c
(galaxy \fIname\fP \fIclass\fP)
.)c
.IE "galaxy command"
is also provided to create an instance of a
.c Galaxy .
.H3 "Connecting Stars and Galaxys
.pp
The next step is to connect the blocks so that they can
pass data among themselves using the
.c connect
command.
.IE "connect command"
This forms a connection between two 
.c Star s
(or
.c Galaxy s)
by connecting their portholes.
A porthole is specified by giving the
.c Star
(or
.c Galaxy )
name followed by the port name within the
.c Star ,
with surrounding parentheses.
The first porthole must be an output
porthole and the second must be an input porthole.
Example:
.(c
(connect (mystar output) (yourstar input))
.)c
The connect command accepts an optional integer delay
parameter:
.(c
(connect (mystar output) (yourstar input) 1)
.)c
specifies one delay on the connection.  This parameter
makes sense only for the SDF and DDF domains; it is
meaningless for DE.
.pp
One or both of the portholes may really be a
.c MultiPortHole .
If so, the effect of doing the connect is to create a new porthole
within the
.c MultiPortHole
and connect to that
(see also the
.c numports
command).
.H3 "Netlist-style connections
.pp
As an alternative to issuing connect commands (which specify
point-to-point connections) you may specify connections netlist-style.
This syntax is used to connect an input to more than one output, for
example (this is called
.i auto-forking ).
Two commands are provided for this purpose.  The
.c node
command creates a node:
.(c
(node \fInodename\fP)
.)c
The
.c nodeconnect
.IE "nodeconnect command"
command connects a porthole to a node:
.(c
(nodeconnect (\fIstarname portname\fP) \fInodename\fP)
.)c
.H3 "Connecting Internal Galaxy Stars and Galaxys to the Outside
.pp
When you define a new
.c Galaxy
there are typically external connections to that
.c Galaxy
that need to be connected through to internal blocks.
The
.c input
.IE "input command"
command is used to add an input porthole to the current
galaxy,
and associate it with an input porthole of one of the contained
.c Star s
within the
.c Galaxy .
An example is:
.(c
(input galaxyin (mystar starin))
.)c
Note: this will not work if
.c starin
is a
.c MultiPortHole
(see the
.c numports
command if you need to connect a
.c "Galaxy PortHole"
to a 
.c MultiPortHole ).
.pp
The
.c output
.IE "output command"
command is analogous to
.c input ,
except that it's for output portholes.  Example:
.(c
(output galaxyout (mystar galaxyout))
.)c
.H3 "Defining States for a Galaxy
.pp
A
.c State
is a piece of data that is assigned to a
.c Galaxy
and can be used to affect its behavior.
Typically the value of a
.c State
is coupled to the
.c State
of blocks within the
.c Galaxy ,
allowing you to customize the behavior of blocks within the
.c Galaxy .
.pp
The
.c state
.IE "state command"
command adds a
.c State
of the given
.c class
to the current
.c Galaxy .
The form of the command is
.(c
(state \fIstate-name\fP \fIstate-class\fP \fIdefault-value\fP)
.)c
.i state-name
is the name to be given to the
.c State .
.i state-class
is
the type of
.c State ;
at present, the supported types are
.c int ,
.c float ,
.c complex ,
and
.c string .
.i default-value
is the default value to be given to the
.c State
if the user of the galaxy does not change it
(using the
.c setstate
command described shortly).
The
.i default-value
must either be an integer (for an
.c int
.c State ),
a floating point number (for a
.c float
.c State
\- although at the moment scientific notation is not supported),
or a quoted string (for a
.c string
.c State ).
.pp
Some examples are:
.(c
(state count int 3)
(state level float 1.0)
(state title string "This is a title")
(state myfreq float galaxyfreq)
.)c
The
.i default-value
can also be an arbitrary arithmetic expression involving
constant values and other
.c State
names (enclosed in quotes); this expression is evaluated when the
simulation starts.  The following state names are predefined:
YES, NO, TRUE, FALSE, PI.  YES and TRUE have value 1; NO and
FALSE have value 0; PI has the value 3.14159... .  Example:
.(c
(state angularFreq "2*PI*freq")
.)c
.H3 "Setting the Value of States
.pp
The
.c setstate
.IE "setstate command"
command is used to change the value of a
.c State.
It can be used in three contexts:
.BU
Change the value of a
.c State
for
.c Star
within the current
galaxy.
.BU
Change the value of a
.c State
for a
.c Galaxy
within the current galaxy.
.BU
Change the value of a
.c State
within the current galaxy.
.lp
The latter would normally be used when you want to perform
multiple simulations using different parameters.
.pp
The syntax of
.c setstate
is
.(c
(setstate \fIblock-name\fP \fIstate-name\fP \fIvalue\fP)
.)c
Here
.BU
.i block-name
is either the name of a
.c Star
or a
.c Galaxy
that is inside the current galaxy,
and it is the block for which the value of the
.c State
is to be changed.
It can also be
.c this ,
which says to change a
.c State
belonging to the current galaxy itself.
.BU
.i state-name
is the name of a
.c State
which you wish to change.
.BU
.i value
is the new value for the
.c State .
The syntax for
.i value
is the same as described in the
.c state
command.
However, the expression for
.i value
may refer to the name of one or more
.c State s
in the current galaxy
or an ancestor of the current galaxy.
.lp
An example of the use of
.c setstate
is given in the section describing
.c defgalaxy
below.
.H3 "Initializing all states"
.pp
The
.c initstate
.IE "initstate command"
command (which takes no arguments) causes all states in the universe
to be initialized (all the initial-value strings are parsed and interpreted).
Note that this action is automatically taken whenever a universe is
run or a schedule is generated; the only reason this command is provided
is so that the user can check on the effect of provided state values
with the
.c show
or
.c dump
commands.
.H3 "Setting a Descriptor
.pp
Every block in \*(PT has a
.i descriptor ,
which is a string that briefly describes the purpose of that block.
The
.c descriptor
command changes the descriptor for the current galaxy,
.IE "descriptor command"
which is
by default "An interpreted galaxy".  Example:
.(c
(descriptor "This galaxy generates a sine wave")
.)c
.H3 "Setting the Number of Ports to a Star
.pp
Some
.c Star s
in \*(PT are defined with multiple-ports.
These multiple-ports have an arbitrary number of connections,
the number of connections being defined by the user of the
.c Star
rather than the
.c Star
itself.
The
.c numports
.IE "numports command"
command applies to
.c Star s
that contain
.c MultiPortHole s;
it causes a number of
.c PortHole s
to be created within the
.c MultiPortHole .
The syntax is
.(c
(numports \fIstar\fP \fIportname\fP \fIn\fP)
.)c
where
.i star
is the name of a
.c Star
within the current galaxy,
.i portname
is the name of a
.c MultiPortHole
in the
.c Star ,
and
.i n
is an integer, representing the number of
.c PortHole s
to be created.
After the
.c PortHole s
are created, they may be referred to by appending
.i #n ,
where
.i n
is an integer, to the multiporthole name, and enclosing the
resulting name in quotes.  There are two reasons to use this command:
to connect the portholes in random order, or if one of the portholes
is to be aliased to a
.c "Galaxy PortHole" .
Here is an example:
.(c
(star summer FloatSum)
(numports summer input 2)
(input galInput (summer "input#1"))
(connect (foo output) (summer "input#2"))
.)c
.H3 "Defining New Galaxys
.pp
The
.c defgalaxy
.IE "defgalaxy command"
command allows the user to define a new class of
.c Galaxy .
The syntax is
.(c
(defgalaxy \fIclass-name\fP
	\fIcommand\fP
	\fIcommand\fP
	...
)
.)c
Here
.i class-name
is the name of the
.c Galaxy
type you are creating.
While it is not required, we suggest that you have the name begin
with a capital letter in accordance with our standard naming convention
\- class names begin with capital letters. 
.i command
may be any of
the commands described above \-
.c star ,
.c galaxy ,
.c connect ,
.c node ,
.c nodeconnect ,
.c input ,
.c output ,
.c numports ,
.c state ,
.c setstate ,
or
.c descriptor .
The defined class is added to the known list, and you can then create
instances of it and add them to other galaxies.
An example is:
.(c
(defgalaxy SinGen
	(descriptor "Generate a sine wave (default frequency 0.05)")

	# The frequency of the sine wave is a state
	(state freq float "0.05")

	(star ramp FloatRamp)
	# The ramp advances by 2*pi each sample
	(setstate ramp step "6.283185307179586")

	# Multiply the ramp by a value, setting the frequency
	(star gain FloatGain)
	# The multiplier is set to "freq"
	(setstate gain gain "freq")

	# Finally the sine generator
	(star sin Sin)

	(connect (ramp output) (gain input))
	(connect (gain output) (sin input))
	(output output (sin output))
)
.)c
In this example, note the use of
.c State s
to allow the frequency of the sine wave generator to be changed.
For example, we could now run the sine generator, changing its
frequency to "0.02", with the interpreter input:
.(c
(galaxy generator SinGen)
(setstate generator freq "0.02")
(star printer Printer)
(connect (generator output) (printer input))
(run 100)
.)c
.pp
You may include a
.c domain
command within a
.c defgalaxy
command.  This creates an object known as a
.c Wormhole ,
which is an interface between two domains.  An example of this
appears in a later section.
.H2 "Showing the Current Status
.pp
The following commands display information about the current state
of the interpreter.
.H3 "Displaying the Known Classes
.pp
The
.c knownlist
.IE "knownlist command"
command displays the classes of
.c Star s
and
.c Galaxy s
on the known list that are usable in the current domain.
The syntax is
.(c
(knownlist)
.)c
.pp
It is also possible to ask for a list of objects available in
other domains; the command
.(c
(knownlist DE)
.)c
displays objects available in the
.c DE
(discrete event)
domain.
.H3 "Displaying Information on a the Current Galaxy or a Class
.pp
If invoked without an argument, the
.c show
.IE "show command"
command displays information on the current galaxy.
If invoked with an argument, the argument
is either the name of a
.c Star
(or
.c Galaxy )
contained in the current galaxy,
or the name of a class on the known list, and information
is shown about that
.c Star
(or
.c Galaxy ).
The syntax is
.(c
(show)
(show \fIstar-name\fP)
(show \fIstar-class\fP)
.)c
.H3 "Recursively Displaying Information on Galaxies or Classes
.pp
The
.c dump
.IE "dump command"
command is similar to
.c show ,
except that it is recursive; it shows in detail the structure of
all
.c Star s
within the
.c Galaxy
it is applied to, at any level.  This
may generate a lot of information.  Like
.c show ,
it may apply to the current galaxy,
a
.c Star
within the current galaxy,
or a class on the known list.
The syntax is:
.(c
(dump)
(dump \fIstar-name\fP)
(dump \fIstar-class\fP)
.)c
.H2 "Running the Simulation"
.pp
Once a simulation has been constructed using the commands previously
described (also see the
.c load
command in section 3.4.2), use the commands in this section to run the
simulation.
.H3 "Creating a Schedule
.pp
The
.c schedule
.IE "schedule command"
command generates and prints the schedule (the order in
which
.c Star s
are invoked).  For the DE interpreter, this command
is not implemented (since there is no "compile time"
DE schedule as there is for SDF).  Syntax:
.(c
(schedule)
.)c
.H3 "Running the Simulation
.pp
The
.c run
.IE "run command"
command generates the schedule and runs it
.i n
times, where
.i n
is the argument (the argument may be omitted; its default value is 1).
For the DE interpreter, this command runs the simulation for
.i n
time
units, and
.i n
may be a floating point number (default 1.0).  If this
command is repeated, the simulation is started from the beginning.
Syntax:
.(c
(run)
(run \fIn\fP)
.)c
.H3 "Continuing a Simulation
.pp
The
.c  cont
.IE "cont command"
command continues the simulation for
.i n
additional steps, or time units.  If the argument is omitted,
the default value of the argument is
the value of the last argument given
to a run or cont command (1.0 if no argument was ever given).
The syntax is
.(c
(cont)
(cont \fIn\fP)
.)c
.H3 "Wrapping Up a Simulation
.pp
The
.c wrapup
.IE "wrapup command"
command calls the wrapup method of each
.c Star ,
signaling the end of the simulation run.
The syntax is
.(c
(wrapup)
.)c
.H2 "Undoing what you've done"
.pp
The commands in this section remove part or all of the structure you
have built with previous commands.
.H3 "Resetting the Interpreter
.pp
The
.c reset
.IE "reset command"
command replaces
.c mainGalaxy
by an empty
.c Galaxy .
Any
.c defgalaxy
definitions you have made are still remembered.
The syntax is
.(c
(reset)
.)c
.H3 "Removing a Star
.pp
The
.c delstar
.IE "delstar command"
command removes the named Star from the current galaxy.
The syntax is
.(c
(delstar \fIname\fP)
.)c
where
.i name
is the name of the star.
.H3 "Removing a connection
.pp
The
.c disconnect
.IE "disconnect command"
command reverses the effect of a previous
.c connect
or
.c nodeconnect
command.  The syntax is
.(c
(disconnect \fIstarname portname\fP)
.)c
where
.i starname
and
.i portname ,
taken together, specify one of the two connected portholes.  Note that
you can disconnect by specifying either end of a porthole for a point-to-point
connection.
.H3 "Removing a node
.pp
The
.c delnode
.IE "delnode command"
command removes a node from the current galaxy.  Syntax:
.(c
(delnode \fInode\fP)
.)c
.H2 "Miscellaneous Commands
.pp
This section describes the remaining interpreter commands.
.H3 "Loading Commands from a File
.pp
For complicated simulations it is best to store your
interpreter commands \(em at least those defining the simulation
connectivity \(em in a file rather than typing them into the
interpreter directly.
This way you can run you favorite editor in one window,
and run the interpreter from another window, easily modifying
the simulation and also keeping a permanent record.
An exception to this is simply changing
.c States
using the
.c setstate
command and running and continuing the simulation using
.c run
and
.c cont
\(em this is normally done interactively with the interpreter.
.pp
The
.c load
.IE "load command"
command reads interpreter commands from the named file, until
end of file or a syntax error occurs.  The # character indicates
that the rest of the line is a comment.  By convention, files
meant to be read by the load command end in ".pt".  Example:
.(c
(load "testfile.pt")
.)c
The tilde notation for users' home directories is allowed; for
example, try
.(c
(load "~ptolemy/demo/figure.pt")
.)c
.H3 "Changing the seed of random number generation
The
.c seed
.IE "seed command"
command changes the seed of the random number generation.  The default
value is 1.  The syntax is
.(c
(seed \fIn\fP)
.)c
where 
.i n
is a long integer.
.H3 "Changing the current directory"
.pp
The
.c chdir
.IE "chdir command"
command changes the interpreter's idea of the current directory.
For example,
.(c
(chdir "~ptolemy/demo")
(load "figure.pt")
.)c
will load the same file as the example in the previous section.
To see what the interpreter's current directory is, you can type
.(c
(exec pwd)
.)c
.H3 "Dynamically linking in new stars"
.pp
The interpreter has the ability to extend itself by linking in outside
object files; the object files in question must define single stars
(they will have the right format if they are produced from preprocessor
input).  Unlike Pigi, the graphical interface, the interpreter will not
automatically run the preprocessor and linker; it expects to be given
object files that have already been compiled.  The syntax is
.(c
(link "\fIobject-file-name\fP")
.)c
.pp
Any star object files that are linked in must only call routines that
are already linked into the interpreter.  For that reason, it is possible
that a star that can be linked into Pigi, the graphic interface, might
not be linkable into the interpreter in some rare cases.
.IE "link command"
.IE "dynamic linking"
.H3 "Messages to the User
.pp
The
.c echo
.IE "echo command"
command prints its arguments, like the Unix echo command.
Arguments may be quoted or unquoted.  It's primarily useful in
interpreter files.  Examples would be
.(c
(echo "Demonstration of a new widget")
(echo "Your definitions have been loaded, you can run the simulation")
.)c
.H3 "Executing a Shell Command
.pp
The
.c exec
.IE "exec command"
command executes a Unix shell command.  Example:
.(c
(exec "ls *.pt")
.)c
.H3 "Giving Up
.pp
The
.c quit
.IE "quit command"
command exits the interpreter.
The syntax is
.(c
(quit)
.)c
.pp
.H3 "Getting Help
.pp
The
.c help
.IE "help command"
command prints help information (a summary of what you see here),
using the Unix
.i more
command.
The syntax is
.(c
(help)
.)c
.H2 "Limitations of the Interpreter"
.pp
There is currently no way to add a
.c MultiPortHole
to a
.c Galaxy.
.pp
The
.c dump
command should pipe through
.i more .
.pp
There are no doubt others!
.H2 "Bug fixes"
.pp
The problem with redefining galaxies has been solved.
.pp
It is no longer a fatal error to run a disconnected universe; you
get an error message and you may then add the missing connections
and run again.
.H2 "A Wormhole example"
.pp
.IE "wormholes in the interpreter"
.IE "domains in the interpreter"
Here is an example of a simulation that contains both an SDF portion
and a DE portion.  The FloatRamp star generates samples 0, 1, 2, ...
The CoinFlip star generates either 0 or 1, with equal probability.
Discard discards or passes its input based on whether its "keep" input
is 0 or 1.  UniformDelay causes a random delay (from a uniform distribution).
The Sampler star samples its input at a constant rate.  Xgraph plots
the result.
.pp
A
.c Wormhole
has an
.i "outer domain"
and an
.i "inner domain" .
The outer domain is determined by the current domain at the time the
user starts the
.c defgalaxy
command to create the wormhole.  The inner domain is determined by
the
.c domain
command that appears inside the galaxy definition.
