Ptolemy has had a number of contributors.
The overall coordinators are Prof. Edward A. Lee and Prof.
David G. Messerschmitt of the EECS department at UC Berkeley.
Joseph Buck has been responsible for
key management of the development of the kernel,
and hence has impacted every aspect of Ptolemy.
He also coordinated virtually all contributions, and
authored both the interpreter and the ptlang preprocessor.
Other key contributors to the kernel include Soonhoi Ha
and Ichiro Kuroda.
Soonhoi Ha authored both the DDF and DE domains, including
many of the basic stars and the basic domain interface,
while Ichiro Kuroda contributed
to the development of the state handling mechanism.
The graphical interface
was written by Edwin Goei, and has been enhanced by several
people, including Wan-Teh Chang.
Andrea Casotto has provided modifications
and improvements to VEM that have considerably improved the user interface.

Several people have had a major impact on the development of Ptolemy
through their major efforts on its predecessor, Gabriel.
Phil Lapsley has had incalculable impact on the directory structure,
project management, documentation, and code generation efforts in Ptolemy.
The first version of the graphical interface
was written by Holly Heine.

Ptolemy is very much an ongoing project, with current efforts
expected to be included in future releases.
Participants in those efforts will be acknowledged when their
work is included in a release.
