\fBPigi Edit Menu\fP
.sp 0.5
Command	Key	Description
=
edit-params	e	T{
To edit the actual parameters of a star, galaxy, or
delay, place the cursor over the icon of the desired object.  To
edit the formal parameters of a galaxy, place the cursor in a
window that contains the galaxy schematic and make sure the cursor
is not over any instance.
T}
.sp 0.5
edit-domain	d	T{
To specify the domain of a galaxy.
If the domain is different from the domain where the galaxy is used,
a wormhole will be automatically created.
All domains currently linked to Pigi will be offered as options.
T}
.sp 0.5
edit-comment	;	T{
A comment is simply text associated with an object.
This command adds or modifies comments.
Comments do not affect the operation of the system.
T}
.sp 0.5
find-name	\0	T{
Some error messages give the name of the offending instance of a block.
This command will cause that block to be highlighted, given its name.
T}
.sp 0.5
clear-marks		T{
Pigi tries to highlight objects when an error
occurs during a compile, or when the find-name
command is invoked.  This clears the highlighting.

Command	Key	Description
=
open-palette	O	T{
Open a palette from a list of palettes.
T}
.sp 0.5
open-facet	F	T{
Open an Oct facet.  A new window is created
displaying the facet.  Pigi commands can be executed from
this window.
T}
.sp 0.5
edit-icon		T{
Opens the facet containing the icon data for
the instance under the cursor.
T}
.sp 0.5
look-inside	i	T{
Opens the facet containing the schematic data
or the star definition for the instance under the cursor.

Command	Key	Description

run	R	T{
Runs a universe.  Cursor must be inside a universe facet.
T}
.sp 0.5
re-run	!	T{
Runs a universe again
with the same parameters given on the
last \fIrun\fP.
T}
.sp 0.5
compile-facet		T{
Compiles the schematic which is under the
cursor.  The compile is recursive and so if the schematic
contains sub-galaxies, each sub-galaxy schematic gets compiled also.

\fBPigi Filter Menu\fP
.sp 0.5
Command	Key	Description
=
equirriple FIR	<	T{
This is a provisional filter design capability, which simply
invokes a public domain Fortran program in its own window
for designing FIR filters using the Parks-McClellan algorithm.
More complete documentation is in the \fBoptfir\fP section of the Almagest.
Note that this program starts in your home directory, so filenames
should be given relative to the home directory.
T}
.sp 0.5
window FIR	>	T{
Like the equirriple FIR,
this is a provisional filter design capability, which simply
invokes a public domain Fortran program in its own window.
It designs FIR filters using the windowing technique.
More complete documentation is in the \fBwfir\fP section of the Almagest.
Note that this program starts in your home directory, so filenames
should be given relative to the home directory.
