The \*(PT interactive graphical interface (pigi) is a design editor
based on tools from the Berkeley CAD framework.
.Id pigi
.IE "graphical interface"
Using pigi, \*(PT applications are constructed graphically,
by interconnecting icons.
Hierarchy is used to manage complexity, to abstract subsystem designs,
and to mix domains.
This document explains version \*(PV, which operates with \*(PT
version \*(PV.
.pp
In \*(PT, applications are constructed by connecting
.c Block s.
.Id Block
In pigi, a block is represented by an icon with \fIterminals\fR,
corresponding to its
.c Porthole s
in \*(PT.
.Id terminal
.Id porthole
The application hierarchy can be traversed by looking inside an icon
to see how it is constructed.
Elementary blocks are called
.c Star s.
.Id Star
Looking inside a star reveals the C++ code that defines it
(actually, most stars are written in a special preprocessor language).
A
.c Galaxy
is a block that contains stars and other galaxies.
.Id Galaxy
From the outside, a galaxy looks like a star, and can be treated
exactly like a star.
But looking inside a galaxy reveals the block diagram that defines it.
A galaxy
has input and output ports (corresponding to terminals
on its icon) that
specify its external connections, and has parameters that are linked
to parameters of its internal blocks.
The outermost block,
which does not have any external connections, is called a
.c Universe.
.Id Universe
A universe encapsulates an entire application.
.pp
A
.c Wormhole,
.Id Wormhole
like a galaxy, looks like a star from the outside,
and contains a block diagram on the inside.
Unlike a galaxy, however, the model of computation
(or the
.c Domain )
.Id Domain
is not the same on the inside as on the outside.
In pigi, wormholes are almost indistinguishable from galaxies.
They are created automatically when two different domains interact.
Domains that are currently supported in pigi include synchronous
dataflow (SDF), dynamic dataflow (DDF), discrete events (DE),
circuit simulation (Thor),
code generation (CG), code generation with dynamic dataflow (CGDDF),
C code generation (CGC, derived from CG), and assembly code generation for
the Motorola DSP56000 family (CG56, derived from CG) and the
DSP96000 family (CG96, derived from CG).
See the manual sections for these domains for an explanation
of their operation.
Code generation domains are distinguished not only by the model
of computation, but also by the language synthesized.
.Id "code generation domains"
Currently, all code generation domains except CG-DDF use the
synchronous dataflow (SDF) model of computation.
Knowledgeable users can define new domains and link them into pigi.
.pp
A
.c State
.Id State
is a data-structure associated with a block, used to remember
data values from one invocation to the next.
For example, the gain of an automatic gain control is a state.
A state need not be dynamic; for instance, the gain of fixed
amplifier is a state.
A \fIparameter\fR
.Id parameter
is the initial value of a state.
Pigi is responsible for storing parameter values.
.pp
Pigi is built on top of
existing CAD tools that are part of the Berkeley CAD framework.  A
central component of this framework is \fBOct\fP, which is a design
.Id Oct
manager.  Oct keeps track of block connections,
parameter values, hierarchy, and file structure.
\fBVEM\fR is an interactive graphical editor for Oct.
.Id VEM
VEM provides one of many ways to examine and edit designs
stored by Oct.
This section gives enough information about VEM to use it with \*(PT
in simple ways.  It is assumed that VEM 8.1, which is
part of the octtools distribution version 5, is being used.
More complete documentation is contained in the VEM
section of the Almagest.
A third component of this system, called \fBRPC\fR, is
.Id RPC
a link between applications and VEM.
.pp
In pigi, the \*(PT kernel runs as an RPC application.
.Id kernel
Users edit designs using VEM, store their designs using Oct,
and execute their application through the RPC link to the \*(PT
kernel.  The \*(PT kernel and VEM are separate Unix\** processes,
.(f
Unix is a trademark of AT&T.
.)f
called \fIvem\fR and \fIpigiRpc\fR.
.Id pigiRpc
These processes interact with another using ``remote procedure calls'',
.Ir "remote procedure calls"
hence the ``Rpc'' suffix.
.pp
Oct objects are called facets.  A \fIfacet\fP is
.Id facet
the fundamental unit that a user edits with VEM.  As an analogy, we can
think of a facet as a text file in a computer system and VEM as a text
editor, such as
.i vi 
or
.i emacs .
However, instead of calling system routines to access the data stored
in a text file like
.i vi
does, VEM calls Oct routines to access the data stored in a
facet.  Thus, Oct manages all data accesses to facets.
Facets may define a universe, a galaxy, or a wormhole.
They also define the physical appearance and formal
terminals of icons that represent stars, galaxies, universes,
and wormholes.  
.pp
A facet may also contain a \fIpalette\fR,
which is simply a collection of disconnected icons.
.Id palette
Palettes are directories of stars, galaxies, universes,
and wormholes in a library.
Note that facet names, like file names in Unix, may not contain spaces.

Here is a quick summary of terms:
.ip \*(PT 1i
The entire design environment.
.ip \fBpigi\fP 1i
A \*(PT graphical interface.
.ip \fBOct\fP 1i
The design manager and database.
.ip \fBVEM\fP 1i
A graphical editor for Oct, upon which pigi is built.
.ip \fBRpc\fP 1i
The link between VEM and the \*(PT kernel.
.ip \fBfacet\fP 1i
A fundamental object in Oct that the user edits with VEM.
.ip \fBpalette\fP 1i
A facet that contains a library of icons.
.ip \fBstar\fP 1i
Lowest level block in \*(PT.
.ip \fBgalaxy\fP 1i
A block in \*(PT that contains sub-blocks,
i.e., other stars or galaxies.  A galaxy also has at least one
input or output port.
.ip \fBuniverse\fP 1i
The outermost block in \*(PT representing a
complete system that the user can execute.
.ip \fBdomain\fP 1i
A model of computation, or a set of semantic rules
defining the behavior of a network of blocks.
In code generation, a domain also corresponds to single target language.
.ip \fBwormhole\fP 1i
A block that does not have the same domain on the outside 
as the inside.
