.UH "Appendix B: VEM Command Summary"
.pp
This appendix contains a summary of VEM commands
and dialog box editing control characters.
The VEM menu is obtained by clicking the middle mouse button in any
facet window.  Its structure is similar to that of the \*(PT command
menu.
The commands are organized according to the submenu used to access them.
The submenu names are listed first in each section.
More complete documentation can be found in the VEM section
of the Almagest.
