.TI "ptcl  The \*(PT Interpreter"
.AU
Joseph Buck
.AE
The \*(PT interpreter, 
.i ptcl ,
provides a textual interface for constructing
systems and performing simulations.  It is based on John Ousterhout's Tcl,
which is an extensible interpreter language.  All the commands of Tcl
are available in
.i ptcl .
This interface is more convenient than the graphical interface
when large complex universes are being created automatically
by some other program.  It is also more convenient when using
a symbolic debugger to debug a new piece of code linked to \*(PT.
