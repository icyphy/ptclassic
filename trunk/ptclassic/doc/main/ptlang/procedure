.H1 "Adding or modifying stars"
.pp
After you create your own star, you can install it into the appropriate
library in the following procedure:
.ip 1.
Make the star icon (refer to the Pigi manual.)
.ip 2.
Go to ~ptolemy/src/domains/XXX/stars, and edit XXXstars.mk and make.template,
adding a line for the star (XXX is the domain name).
.ip 3.
Rebuild the system.
.pp
Sometimes, you may want to modify an existing star.  Besides modifying
the code itself, you should reflect your changes in the documents
which contain that star description and in the demo programs.  
First of all, using Pigi, correct the demo programs which contain the star.
To update the documentations, you may want to look at: 
.ip (1) 
XXX{star_name}.pl, \fBexplanation\fR item. 
.ip (2) 
domains/XXX/doc/demos.  Some demos may use the modified star, and
have the out-of-dated description.
.ip (3)
domains/XXX/doc/overall.  The domain manual may use the modified
star as an example.
