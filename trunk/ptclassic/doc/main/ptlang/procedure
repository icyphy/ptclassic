.H1 "Adding stars permanently to Ptolemy"
.pp
If you create stars that are to be used by everyone in a group, it
might be easiest if you make the star a permanent part of \*(PT.
Here is the procedure (assuming, of course, that you have permission
to modify the \*(PT official directories):
.pp
After you create your own star, you can install it into the appropriate star
library in the following procedure:
.ip 1.
Make the star icon (refer to the Pigi manual.)
.ip 2.
Go to ~ptolemy/src/domains/XXX/stars, and edit XXXstars.mk and make.template,
adding a line for the star (XXX is the domain name).
.ip 3.
Rebuild the system (change to ~ptolemy and type "make").
.pp
Sometimes, you may want to modify an existing star.  Besides modifying
the code itself, you should reflect your changes in the documents
which contain that star description and in the demo programs.  
First of all, using Pigi, correct the demo programs which contain the star.
To update the documentation, you may want to look at: 
.ip (1) 
XXX{star_name}.pl, \fBexplanation\fR item. 
.ip (2) 
domains/XXX/doc/demos.  Some demos may use the modified star, and
have the out-of-date description.
.ip (3)
domains/XXX/doc/overall.  The domain manual may use the modified
star as an example.
.pp
Where possible, it is preferable to ``modify'' a star by deriving another
star from it that has the increased functionality than by replacing
the existing star.
