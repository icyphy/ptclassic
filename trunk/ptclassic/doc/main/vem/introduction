VEM is a graphical editor for designs that are stored using the Oct
design manager.  The \*(PT interactive graphical interface (pigi)
uses VEM.  A process called \fIpigiRpc\fR runs as a VEM application.
Most users can get all the information they need to run pigi
from the pigi section of the Almagest.
This section contains more extensive documentation of VEM,
and is extracted from standard documentation
for the octtools distribution.
No Oct documentation is included.
This is required only by programmers wishing to modify pigiRpc,
and is available from the Industrial Liaison Program office,
Dept. of EECS, UC Berkeley, Berkeley CA 94720.
