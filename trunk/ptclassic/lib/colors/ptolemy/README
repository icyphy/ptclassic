This directory contains the definitions of colors used by Vem
when running Ptolemy.  To change these, edit the file colors.pat.
Then run "installColors".

The file colors.pat defines the colors used by vem to display ptolemy
facets.  In Vem terminology, it defines the "colors" portion of the
'ptolemy technology.' The colors can be changed, and users can define
their own colors.

See ~ptolemy/src/utils/installColors/README for information on
how to modify the colors.

Unfortunately, you have to jump through hoops to get the "P"
command to open your new palette, if you make a new palette.
The default palette is stored
in "~ptolemy/lib/colors/ptolemy/layers:schematic:contents".
This is accessed by Vem as "($OCTTOOLS)/tech/colors/layers:schematic:contents",
where OCTTOOLS is an environment variable normally set to "~ptolemy"
and "tech" is a symbolic link in ~ptolemy.  You have to change
set OCTTOOLS in your environment to point to some intermediate
directory, then in that directory, put a symbolic link to the directory
where you stored your technology.
