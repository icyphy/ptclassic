GENERAL
-------
Ptolemy version 0.4 uses different names for stars than previous
versions.  The star names were changed to be consistent and more
descriptive of their functionality.  Any galaxies built using a pre-0.4
release must be converted to use the new star names.  The script
``~ptolemy/lib/rename/sdf.fixref'' is provided to perform the
conversion automatically.  In each directory where you have ptolemy
cells (facets), invoke the script:

	~ptolemy/lib/rename/sdf.fixref

The script will adjust the names of all the stars in the cell to use
the new 0.4 names.  You can also convert a single cell (instead of all
the cells in the directory) using the command:

	~ptolemy/lib/rename/sdf.fixref -cell cell_name

where cell_name is the name of the cell to convert.

Also, if you wrote your own stars derived from one of the standard SDF
stars, you may have to change your source code to reflect the name
changes.  If you run the above script in the directory where you have
your ".pl" file, the script will attempt automatic conversion.


EXPERIMENTAL DOMAINS
--------------------
The experimental domains cg56 and cg96 also had similar name changes.
These domains have not been previously released, thus it is unlikely
you have an universes using these domains.  However, if you do,
you can use the scripts
	~ptolemy/lib/rename/cg56.fixref
and
	~ptolemy/lib/rename/cg96.fixref
as described above for SDF stars.


PTOLEMY HOME CONVERSION
-----------------------
Ptolemy version 0.4 has eliminated use of the '~ptolemy' dependencies
in most places, and substitutes the environment variable '$PTOLEMY'.
This change will be entirely transparent to most users, since Ptolemy
programs will still use '~ptolemy' if '$PTOLEMY' is not set.  The above
scripts will change all cells to use '$PTOLEMY' and not '~ptolemy'.
