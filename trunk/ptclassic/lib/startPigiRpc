# This script is designed for use by folks who use a shell other than
# csh, where that shell has nothing analogous to .cshrc to set up the
# environment.  It sets up the environment correctly for pigiRpc.  To use
# it, make this script executable, set the PIGIRPC environment variable
# to the full path of this script, and type "pigi".

# Define this variable to point to the root of the Ptolemy directory.
# You may need to change it for your system.
PTOLEMY=/usr/users/ptolemy

# Set ARCH properly.  SunOS has this
test -x /bin/arch && ARCH=`/bin/arch`
# Ultrix has this
test -x /bin/machine && ARCH=`/bin/machine`

# If ARCH still is not set you need to do something else!
export ARCH

# Add the Ptolemy directories to the PATH.  You may also need to add
# other directories if pigi fails to find any programs, or if some
# of your private stars want to invoke special programs that need to
# be on the path.

PATH=$PTOLEMY/bin:$PTOLEMY/bin.${ARCH}:$PATH
export PATH

# Now exec the real pigiRpc.

exec pigiRpc $*
