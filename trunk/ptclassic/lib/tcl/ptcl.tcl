# This is the startup file for ptcl.  It is run by the ptcl binary
# after initializing all the ptolemy extensions to tcl (primarily
# the PTcl class's commands), but before any user's rc file is
# run, and before any command line options like -f have been processed.
#
# We must find and load the tcl libraries, and then do any
# argument processing we want.
