# The gcc INSTALL file says:
#     If you are building with a previous GNU C compiler, do not use
#     `CC=gcc' on the make command or by editing the Makefile.  Instead,
#     use a full pathname to specify the compiler, such as
#     `CC=/usr/local/bin/gcc'.  This is because make might execute the
#     `gcc' in the current directory before all of the compiler
#     components have been built.
# If you already have gcc, you will need to change this variable, or
# building gcc/main.c may fail
#GNU_BUILD_CC=/usr/tools/gnu/bin/gcc
GNU_BUILD_CC=cc

# Special CC for irix5.  If you are using gcc to recompile, use this:
#IRIX5_GNU_BUILD_CC=/users/ptolemy/gnu/irix5/bin/gcc
# If you are using cc to compile gnu under irix5, use this:
IRIX5_GNU_BUILD_CC=cc -Wf,-XNh1500,-XNg1500 -Olimit 3000 -cckr -O1
