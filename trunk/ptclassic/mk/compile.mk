# The following symbols are used by this makefile.  They should be
# defined by the parent makefile prior to including this makefile:
# SRCS
# OBJS
# LIB
# DOMAIN, DOMAIN_2, DOMAIN_3
# STAR_MK	Specifies the name of the star-reference file to build;
#		both a C-verion (e.g., cgcstars.c) using genStarTable and
#		a makefile version (e.g., cgcstars.mk) using genStarList 
#		is built.  The variable "STAR_MK" should be given without
#		a file suffix (e.g., just "cgcstars").
# GENSTARVARS	A variable passed to genStarTable to allow stars other
#		than those defined by PL_SRCS to be generated.

# This file is used when there are files to be compiled.  Usually a 
# make.template file is present if there are files to be compiled.
# See no-compile.mk for a similar file that is to be used when there
# are no files to be compiled.

# The optimizer in g++-2.7.2 and later have bugs that we workaround by turning
# off the optimizer.  The problem is that when the optimizer is turned on, 
# certain files end up needing  operator= or a copy constructor from 
# a parent class.  Unfortunately, the parent class does not define what
# is needed
#
# The following files use these two rules:
#  de/contrib/stars/make.template
#  de/tcltk/stars/make.template
#  de/stars/make.template
#  cg56/stars/make.template
#  sdf/matlab/stars/make.template
#
# We include this rule in common.mk rather than config-g++.mk so that
# we can use any architecture specific variables in the
# UNOPTIMIZED_COMPILE_RULE.  Having this rule in config-g++.mk means
# that we don't see architecture dependent variables.
