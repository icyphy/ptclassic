# Programs to use
#
RANLIB =	ranlib
CC =		gcc

# In config-$PTARCH.mk, we set the following variables.  We need to 
# use only the following variables so that we can use them elsewhere, say
# for non-optimized compiles.
# OPTIMIZER - The setting for the optimizer, usually -O2.
# MEMLOG    - Formerly used to log memory allocation and deallocation.
# WARNINGS  - Flags that print warnings.
# ARCHFLAGS - Architecture dependent flags, useful for determining which
#	      OS we are on.  Often of the form -DPTSOL2_4.
# LOCALCCFLAGS - Other architecture dependent flags that apply to all releases
#	      of the OS for this architecture for c++
# LOCALCFLAGS - Other architecture dependent flags that apply to all releases
#	      of the OS for this architecture for c++
# USERFLAGS - Ptolemy makefiles should never set this, but the user can set it.

OPTIMIZER =
# -Wsynth is a g++ flag first introduced in g++-2.6.x.
WARNINGS =	-Wall -Wcast-qual -Wsynth
LOCALCCFLAGS =	-g

CFLAGS =	$(OPTIMIZER) $(MEMLOG) $(WARNINGS) \
			$(ARCHFLAGS) $(LOCALCFLAGS) $(USERFLAGS)

#
# Variables for the linker
#

# Flag that cc expects to create statically linked binaries.
# Binaries that are shipped should be statically linked.
# Note that currently vem is built with cc, not gcc, so vem uses
# this flag. See also config-g++.mk
CC_STATIC = 	-static

#
# Directories to use
