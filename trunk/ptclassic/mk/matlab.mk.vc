# matlab.mk :: Common definitions for the Ptolemy interface to Matlab
# Version: @(#)matlab.mk.vc	1.1 08/16/97
#
# We have to handle four cases:
# (1\2) Matlab is\is not installed at compile time
# (3\4) Matlab is\is not installed at link time
#
# Matlab is installed if the matlabRootDir script returns an non-empty string
# -- If Matlab is not installed, set MATLABDIR to $(ROOT)\src\compat\matlab
# -- If Matlab is installed, then set MATLABDIR accordingly
#
# The Matlab include files are located in $(MATLABDIR)\extern\include
# At compile time, sdfmatlabstars.o and libsdfmatlabstars.so are created
# At link time, Ptolemy is linked against libexttools.so (MatlabIfc class)
# and either
# (a) libptmatlab.so if Matlab is not installed, or
# (b) libmat.so if Matlab is installed.
#
# If Matlab is installed, the old way to determine the Matlab architecture is
# MATARCH := $(shell $(ROOT)\bin\matlabArch $(PTARCH))
# Now, MATARCH is set by the config makefiles.

# matlabRootDir traverses the user's path, so we only run it when
# we really need it.
