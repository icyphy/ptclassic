Multiplex any number of inputs onto one output stream.  At each
firing, blockSize particles are consumed on each input port, but
only one of these blocks of particles is copied to the output.
The one copied is determined by the "control" input.
Integers from 0 through N-1 are accepted at the "control" input,
where N is the number of inputs.  If the control input is outside
this range, an error is signaled.
