README file for ptolemy/src/domains/c50


The Ptolemy c50 domain generates code for the Texas Instruments
TMS320C50 fixed-point DSP processor.  To make much use of this domain,
you will need a PC with a C50.

The c50 domain is based on an initial implementation by Andreas
Baensch and Prof. Fritz Heinrichmeyer at FernUniverstitat in Hagen,
Germany.

Luis Gutierrez and Brian Evans have fleshed out the c50 domain star
library.



Installation
------------
In August of 1996, the c50 domain was released as a tar file overlay for
Ptolemy0.6.

To install this tar file, untar it inside your Ptolemy distribution:
	cd $PTOLEMY/..
	gunzip /tmp/pt-0.6.c50.src.tar.gz
	tar -xf /tmp/pt-0.6.c50.src.tar

Window and RaisedCosine star in c50/dsp/stars need the ptdsp library,
located in $PTOLEMY/src/utils/libptdsp.  This library is not part of
the Ptolemy0.6 release, but is included with this tar overlay.

The following files need to be modified to use the c50 domain:

$PTOLEMY/MAKEARCH		- Add c50 to EXPDOMAINS

$PTOLEMY/mk/ptbin.mk		- Add 'C50 = 1' to the FULL section so that
				the c50 domain is in a full pigiRpc	

$PTOLEMY/mk/stars/mk		- Add the c50 domain in several places.

$PTOLEMY/src/domains/makefile 	- Add the c50 domain to EXPDOMAINS

$PTOLEMY/src/utils/makefile 	- Add libptdsp to DIRS

The file ptolemy/src/domains/c50/pt-0.6.c50.patch is a patch that
makes the above changes.  To patch the vanilla Ptolemy 0.6 sources, do:

cd $PTOLEMY; patch -p3 < $PTOLEMY/src/domains/c50/pt-0.6.c50.patch
 
patch binaries for HPUX10.01, Solaris2.4 and SunOS4.1.3 are available
via anonymous ftp in the hppa, sol2 and sun4 subdirectories at
ftp://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/pub/gnu

Using the c50 domain
--------------------

The C50 domain is meant to run on a Linux machine with the DSK starter
board and kit.  The C50 files are downloaded to the chip via a dos shell.
