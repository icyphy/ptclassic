README file for ptolemy/src/domains/c50

The Ptolemy c50 domain generated code for the Texas Instruments C50 chip.
To make much use of this domain, you will need a PC with a C50.

Installation
------------
In August of 1996, the c50 domain was released as a tar file overlay for
Ptolemy0.6.

To install this tar file, untar it inside your Ptolemy distribution:
	cd $PTOLEMY/..
	gunzip /tmp/pt-0.6.c50.src.tar.gz
	tar -xf /tmp/pt-0.6.c50.src.tar

Window and RaisedCosine star in c50/dsp/stars need the ptdsp library,
located in $PTOLEMY/src/utils/libptdsp.  This library is not part of
the Ptolemy0.6 release, but is included with this tar overlay.

The following files need to be modified to use the c50 domain:

$PTOLEMY/MAKEARCH		- Add c50 to EXPDOMAINS

$PTOLEMY/mk/ptbin.mk		- Add 'C50 = 1' to the FULL section so that
				the c50 domain is in a full pigiRpc	

$PTOLEMY/mk/stars/mk		- Add the c50 domain in several places.

$PTOLEMY/src/domains/makefile 	- Add the c50 domain to EXPDOMAINS

$PTOLEMY/src/utils/makefile 	- Add libptdsp to DIRS

The file ptolemy/src/domains/c50/pt-0.6.c50.patch is a patch that
makes the above changes.  To patch the vanilla Ptolemy 0.6 sources, do:

cd $PTOLEMY; patch < $PTOLEMY/src/domains/c50/pt-0.6.c50.patch
