.H1 "Writing Code Generation Stars" 
.pp
Code generation stars are very similar to the C++ simulation stars.
The main differences is that the initialization (\fBsetup()\fR), run
time (\fBgo()\fR ), and termination (\fBwrapup()\fR) methods generate
code to be compiled and executed later.  Additionally, code generation
stars have two more methods, called \fBinitCode()\fR and \fBexecTime()\fR.
.Id "initCode, method"
.Id "execTime, method"
.pp
The setup() method is called before the schedule is generated and
before any memory is allocated.  In this method, a star writer can
altar a array state buffer size which can then be properly allocated
and automatically initialized.  The initCode() method of a star is called
after the the static schedule has been generate and before schedule is
fired. This method is used to generate the code outside of the main
loop such as initialization code and procedure declaration code. The go
function is used to generate the main loop code for the star.
Finally, the wrapup function is used to generate the code after the
main loop.
.pp
The execTime() method returns an integer specifying the relative time to
execute the main loop code of a code generation star.  These numbers
have meaning relative to one another and are used by the parallel
schedulers.  In the assembly code generation domains, the integer
returned is the number of instruction cycles. The better the execTime
estimates are for each star, the more efficient the parallel schedule
becomes.
.pp
.Id "CGStar, class"
The \fBCGStar\fR class is the base class for all code generation stars,
such as C-code generation stars and assembly code generation stars. In
this section, we will explain the common features  that the CGStar
class provides for all derivative code generation stars.
.pp
As a simple example to see how code generation stars are written, let's
write a adder star for the C code generation domain.  The \fBdefstar\fP
is almost identical as for a simulation star:
.(c
defstar {
	name {Add}
	domain {CGC}
	desc { Output the sum of the inputs, as a floating value.  }
	author { J. Pino }
	input {
		name {input1}
		type {float}
	}
	input {
		name {input2}
		type {float}
	}
	output {
		name {output}
		type {float}
	}
.)c
.H2 "Codeblocks"
.Id "Codeblock"
.pp
Next we have to define the C code which will be used to generate the
run-time code.  For this we use a codeblock.  A codeblock is a
pseudo-language specification of a code segment.  By pseudo-language we
mean that the block of code is written in the target language with
interspersed macros.  Macros will be explained in the following section
and the exact function of C code generation macros will be described in
the CGC chapter.  The \fBcodeblock\fR directive defines a block of code
with an associated identifying name ("addCB" in this case).
.(c
	codeblock (addCB) {
	/* output = input1 + input2 */
	$ref(output) = $ref(input1) + $ref(input2);
	}
.)c
.pp
Special care should be given to codeblock specification.  Within each
line, spaces, tabs, and new line characters are important because they
are preserved.  For this reason, the brackets "{ }" should not be on
the same lines with the code.  Had "addCB" been defined as follows:
.(c
	codeblock (addCB) {	/* output = input1 + input2 */
	$ref(output) = $ref(input1) + $ref(input2); }
.)c
The line \fB$ref(output) = $ref(input1) + $ref(input2);\fR
would be lost! This is because anything preceding the closing "}" on
the same line is discarded by the preprocessor (ptlang).  Secondly, the
spaces and tabs between the opening "{" and the first non-space
character will be ignored.
.pp
The first definition of the "addCB" codeblock is translated by the
preprocessor (ptlang) into a definition of a static public member in
the ".h" file:
.(c
class CGCAdd : public CGCStar
{
	...
	static CodeBlock addCB;
	...
}
.)c
An associated constructor call will be generated in the ".cc" file:
.(c
CodeBlock CGCAdd :: addCB (
"	/* output = input1 + input2 */\en"
"	$ref(output) = $ref(input1) + $ref(input2);\en"
);
.)c
The argument is a single string, divided into lines for convenience.
.pp
The following will complete our definition of the add star:
.(c
	go {
		addCode(addCB);
	}
}
.)c
.pp
Notice that the code is added in the go method, thus implying that the code is
generated in the main loop.
.pp
The star just defined is a very simple star.  Typical code
generation stars will define many codeblocks.  Conditional code
generation is easily accomplished, as is done in the following example:
.(c
	go {
		if (parameter == YES)
			addCode(yesblock);
		else
			addCode(noblock);
	}
.)c
.pp
So far, we use \fBaddCode()\fR method to generate the code inside the
main loop body. We can use \fBaddProcedure()\fR method to generate a
procedure declaration outside the main body.  Refer to the Target:Code
Streams section for documentation on the addCode and addProcedure
methods.
.Ir "addCode, method"
.Ir "addProcedure, method"
.H2 "Macros"
.Id "macros, CG stars"
.pp
In code generation stars, the inputs and outputs no longer hold values,
but instead correspond to target resources where values will be
stored.  (for example, memory locations/registers in assembler
generation, or global variables in c-code generation) A star writer can
also define States which may can specify the need for global
resources.
.pp
A code generation star, however, does not have knowledge of the
available global resources or the global variables/tables which have
already been defined in the generated code.  For star writers, a set of
macros to access the global resources is provided. The macros are
expanded in a language or target specific manner after the target has
allocated the resources properly.  In this section, we discuss the
macros defined in the CGStar class.
.UH "$ref(name):"
.Ir "ref, CG macro"
Returns a reference to a state or a port. If the argument, name, refers
to a port, it is functionally equivalent to \fBname%0\fR operator in
the SDF simulation stars.  If a star has a multi-porthole, say
\fBinput\fR, the first real porthole is \fBinput#1\fR.  To access the
first porthole, we use \fB$ref(input#1)\fR or
\fB$ref(input#internal_state)\fR where \fBinternal_state\fR has the
current value, 1.
.UH "$ref(name,offset):"
Returns a reference to an array state or a port with an offset that is
not negative.  For a port, it is functionally equivalent to \fBname%offset\fR
operator in SDF simulation stars. 
.UH "$val(state-name):"
.Ir "val, CG macro"
Returns the current value of the state. If the state is an array state,
the macro will return a string of all the elements of the array spaced
by the new line character.  The advantage of not using \fB$ref\fR macro
in place of \fB$val\fR is that no additional target resources need to be
allocated.
.UH "$size(name):"
.Ir "size, CG macro"
Returns the size of the argument state/port. The size of a state is one
except for an array state whose size is defined to be the number of
elements.  The size of a port is the buffer size allocated to the port.
The buffer size is usually larger than the number of tokens consumed or
produced through that port.
.UH "$starSymbol(name):"
.Ir "starSymbol, CG macro"
Returns a unique label in the star instance scope.  The instance scope
is owned by a particular instance of that star in a graph.
Furthermore, the scope is alive across all firings of that particular
star.  For example, two CG stars will have two distinct star instance
scopes.  As an example, we show some parts of ptlang file of the 
.c CGCPrinter
star.
.(c
	initCode {
		...
		StringList s;
                s << "    FILE* $starSymbol(fp);";
                addDeclaration(s);
                addInclude("<stdio.h>");
                addCode(openfile);
           	... 
        }
	codeblock (openfile) {
    if(!($starSymbol(fp)=fopen("$val(fileName)","w"))) {
        fprintf(stderr,"ERROR: cannot open output file for Printer star.\n");
        exit(1);
    }
	}
.)c
The file pointer \fBfp\fR for a star instance should be unique
globally, and the $starSymbol macro guarantees the uniqueness. Within
the same star instance, the macro returns the same label. Refer to the
CGC domain document for the method: addDeclaration and addInclude.
.UH "$sharedSymbol(list,name):"
.Ir "sharedSymbol, CG macro"
Returns the symbol for \fBname\fR in the \fBlist\fR scope.  This macro
is provide so that various stars in the graph can share the same data
structures such as sin/cos lookup tables and conversion table from
linear to mu-law PCM encoder. These global data structures should be
created and initialized once in the generated code. The macro
sharedSymbol does not provide the method to generate the code, but does
provide the method to create a label for the code.  To generate the
code only once, refer to Target:Code Streams section.  A example where
a shared symbol is used is in \fBCGCPCM\fR star.
.(c
    codeblock (sharedDeclarations)
    {
        int $sharedSymbol(PCM,offset)[8];

        /* Convert from linear to mu-law */
        int $sharedSymbol(PCM,mulaw)(x)
        double x;
        {
            double m;
            m = (pow(256.0,fabs(x)) - 1.0) / 255.0;
            return 4080.0 * m;
        }
    }
    codeblock (sharedInit)
    {
        /* Initialize PCM offset table. */
        {
            int i;
            double x = 0.0;
            double dx = 0.125;

            for(i = 0; i < 8; i++, x += dx)
            {
                $sharedSymbol(PCM,offset)[i] = $sharedSymbol(PCM,mulaw)(x);
            }
        }
    }
    initCode {
	...
        if (addGlobal(sharedDeclarations, "$sharedSymbol(PCM,PCM)"))
            addCode(sharedInit);
    }
.)c
The above code creates a conversion table and a conversion function
from linear to mu-law PCM encoder. The conversion table is named
\fBoffset\fR , and belongs to the \fBPCM\fR class. The conversion
function is named \fBmulaw\fR, and belongs to the same PCM class. Other
stars can access that table or function by saying
\fB$sharedSymbol(PCM,offset)\fR or \fB$sharedSymbol(PCM,mulaw)\fR
.  The initCode method, tries to put the sharedDeclarations codeblock
into the global scope (by addGlobal() method in the CGC domain). That
code block is given a unique label by \fB$sharedSymbol(PCM,PCM)\fR.  If
the codeblock has not been previously defined, addGlobal returns true,
thus allowing addCode(sharedInit). If there are more than one instances
of this star, only one instance will succeed adding the code.
.UH "$label(name):"
.UH "$codeblockSymbol(name):"
.Ir "label, CG macro"
.Ir "codeblockSymbol, CG macro"
Return a unique symbol in the codeblock scope. Both label and
codeblockSymbol are names for the same macro.  The codeblock scope only
lives as long as a codeblock is having code generated from it.  Thus if
a star uses addCode() more than once on a particular codeblock, all
codeblock instances will have unique symbols. A example of where this
is used in the \fBCG56HostOut\fR star.
.(c
        codeblock(cbSingleBlocking) {
$label(wait)
        jclr    #m_htde,x:m_hsr,$label(wait)
        jclr    #0,x:m_pbddr,$label(wait)
        movep   $ref(input),x:m_htx
        }
        codeblock(cbMultiBlocking) {
        move    #$addr(input),r0
        .LOOP   #$val(samplesOutput)
$label(wait)
        jclr    #m_htde,x:m_hsr,$label(wait)
        jclr    #0,x:m_pbddr,$label(wait)
        movep   x:(r0)+,x:m_htx
        .ENDL
        nop
        }
.)c
The above two codeblocks use a label named \fIwait\fR. The \fB$label\fR
macro will assign unique strings for each codeblock.
.pp
The base CGStar class provides the above 8 macros. In the derived
classes, we can add more macros, or redefine the meaning of
these macros. Refer to each domain document to see how these
macros are actually expanded.
.H2 "Possibilities for Effective Buffering"
.pp
In principle, block communicate each other through porthole
connections. In code generation domain, we allocate a buffer for
each input-output connection by default. There are some stars, however,
that do not modify data at all. A good, and also
ubiquitous, example is a \fBFork\fR 
.Sr Fork, code generation
star. When a Fork star has \fIN\fR outputs, the default behavior is to
create \fIN\fR buffers for output connections and copy data from input
buffer to \fIN\fR output buffers, which is a very expensive and silly
approach. Therefore, we pay special attention stars displaying this
type of behavior.  In the start method these stars, \fBforkInit()\fR
method is invoked to indicate that the star is a Fork-type star.  
For example, the \fBCGCFork\fR star is defined as
.(c
defstar {
	name { Fork }
	domain { CGC }
	desc { Copy input to all outputs }
	version { @(#)CGCFork.pl	1.6	11/11/92 }
	author { E. A. Lee }
	copyright { 1992 The Regents of the University of California }
	location { CGC demo library }
	explanation {
Each input is copied to every output.  This is done by the way the buffers
are laid out; no code is required.
	}
	input {
		name {input}
		type {ANYTYPE}
	}
	outmulti {
		name {output}
		type {=input}
	}
	constructor {
		noInternalState();
	}
	start {
		forkInit(input,output);
	}
	exectime {
		return 0;
	}
}
.)c
Were ever possible, code generation domains take advantage of Fork-type
stars by not allocating output buffers, but instead the stars reuse the
input buffers.  Unfortunately, in the current implementation, Fork-type
stars can not do their magic if the buffer size gets too large.  Here,
forks that copy inputs to outputs must be used.
.pp
.Id "Spread, star"
Another example of a Fork-Type star is the \fBSpread\fR star. The star
receives \fIN\fR tokens and spreads them to more than one destination.
Thus, each output buffer may share a subset of its input buffer. We
call this relationship \fIembedding\fR: the outputs are embedded in the
input. For example, in the \fBCGCSpread\fR star:
.Sr Spread CGC
.(c
        setup {
                MPHIter iter(output);
                CGCPortHole* p;
                int loc = 0;
                while ((p = (CGCPortHole*) iter++) != 0) {
                        input.embed(*p, loc);
                        loc += p->numXfer();
                }
        }
.)c
Notice that the output is a multi-porthole. During setup, we express
how each output is embedded in the input starting at \fIloc\fR
location.  At buffer allocation stage, we do not allocate buffers for
the outputs, but instead reuse the input buffer for all outputs. This
feature, however, has not implemented been implemented in the assembly
language generation domains. 
.pp
.Id "Collect, star"
.Sr Collect CGC
A \fBCollect\fR star embeds its inputs in its output buffer:
.(c
        setup {
                MPHIter iter(input);
                CGCPortHole* p;
                int loc = 0;
                while ((p = (CGCPortHole*) iter++) != 0) {
                        output.embed(*p, loc);
                        loc += p->numXfer();
                }
        }
.)c
.Id "static buffering"
Other examples of embedded relationships are \fBUpSample\fR and
\fBDownSample\fR stars. One restriction of embedding, however, is that
the embedded buffer must be static. Automatic insertion of Spread and
Collect stars in multi-processor targets(refer to the target section)
guarantees static buffering. If there is no delay (ie, no initial
token) in the embedded buffer, the static buffering is enforced by
default.  A buffer is called \fIstatic\fR when a star instance consumes
or produces data in the same buffer location in any schedule period. If
the buffer size divides the \fIlcm\fR value of the number of tokens
consumed and produced, the buffer is static.
