This directory contains stand-alone files used for developing
and timing VIS code. 

NOTE: these files will only compile under Sun CC.

To run the simulator, create or open a test universe (try the
universe "test" in this directory):

  To run, hit on Go. The simulator will pop up. Type in
  "file test.sim". The times for a star follow the name
  of that star; times are cumulative. No idea what the
  units are.

  The simulator documentation is at /opt/SUNWincas/manuals/INCASuserguide.ps
