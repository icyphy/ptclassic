This demo shows what the
.c Repeater
star does.
The
.c Repeater
star consumes one data input and one control input.
The value of the control input determines how many copies
of the input data to be produced.  The
.c Repeater
star may be useful to represent a data-dependent iteration 
construct.   In this demo, since the
.c Repeater 
star is not a SDF star, the SDF domain has a wormhole of DDF
domain.  The inputs to the
.c Repeater
star are provided with two ramp generators. The display
shows a staircase with growing flat length.
