	explanation {
This block generates an output at the stopTime of the
.c DEScheduler
controlling the block.  It is useful for clocking the input of the
.c Sampler
or statistical Blocks in order to observe their final outputs at the end
of the simulation. It generates a float output instead of an int output
like the 
.c DEStopTimer
in the standard DE star library.
