This system demonstrates the pitfalls of using a simple
voice-recovery technique such as zero-sample substitution in
an ADPCM packet-switched network.

 This demonstrations reads 8 kHz voice samples and converts
them into a 32 kbps stream using Adaptive Differential
Pulse Code Modulation (ADPCM).

 The ADPCM coding is implemented using an
.c LMS
star.
 The bits in the coder output stream are loaded into a
.c SeqATMCell
in which sequence numbers will be set using a modulo-8
numbering scheme.
 The
.c SeqATMCells
are then loaded into
.c NetworkCells
for transport over the network.
 During transmission over the network, it is possible that some
cells may be dropped by the 
.c LossyInput
galaxy.
 A zero-sample substitution method is used to fill in for the dropped cells.
 This causes mistracking to occur between the coder and the decoder since
transmitted codewords are determined sequentially.
 This mistracking is often fatal and will cause the decoder to become unstable.
 A 
.c limit 
star has been used in the decoder to keep unstable samples
from reaching infinity.
 A graphical output shows a comparison between the quantization-error power
and the output-error power.
 Given no lost cells, these curves would be identical.
 However, the output-error curve is likely to be headed
for infinity if a cell is dropped.

 The default parameters in this demonstration are set so that
100 samples are encoded every iteration which will fill
approximately 1.04 cells.
 Running the demonstration for 290 iterations will produce 302 cells
consuming about 29,000 voice samples.
