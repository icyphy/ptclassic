Demonstrate the use of the FIFOQueue and Stack stars.
A Poisson counting process is enqueued on both stars,
and is dequeued at a regular rate, every 1.0 time units.
The output of the FIFOQueue is always monotonically increasing,
because of the FIFO policy, but the output of the Stack need not
be.  The Stack is set with a smaller capacity than the FIFOQueue,
so it overflows first.  Overflow events are displayed.

This demonstration feeds a
.c FIFOQueue
and a
.c Stack
with a Poisson counting process
with average interarrival time of 1.0.
An output is demanded from the queue
block at regular intervals of 1.0 using a
.c Clock.
Hence, the arrivals and departures are precariously balanced.
.pp
When an output is demanded and the queue or stack is empty, then no output
is produced until the next arrival at the queue input.
This shows up in the plots as intervals of greater than 1.0 between
outputs of the queue and stack.
If more demand inputs arrive while the queue is still empty,
they are ignored.
This shows up as successive zero-valued outputs in the size plots.
(Notice that the sizes of the stack and the queue should always be the same.)
.pp
It is possible for the demand inputs to be accumulated until they can
be satisfied.  Just set the \fIconsolidateDemands\fR parameter of the
FIFOQueue or Stack block to FALSE.  This will have the effect of keeping
the sizes much smaller, because during large interarrival times
the FIFOQueue or Stack accumulates many demands that can later be used up
when the interarrival times are small.
.pp
To keep the queue size from growing indefinitely it is constrained
to a maximum size of 4 (for the
.c FIFOQueue )
and 3 (for the
.c Stack ).
When the queue or stack reaches its capacity, it accepts no further inputs,
and the input events are sent to the overflow output.
This shows up on the "Data queued" and "Data stacked" plots
as a second trace.  Notice also the gaps in the queue and stack outputs.
For instance, if value 29 is followed by value 32,
then two input events, with values 30 and 31, were lost due
to queue overflow, and will not appear at the queue or stack output.
.pp
.IE Geodesic
In \*(PT, the arc connecting two blocks is implemented with a
.c Geodesic,
which behaves like a FIFO queue with capacity only bounded
by the amount memory in your computer.
However, the geodesic will normally
not hold particles after the simulation time
has passed the time stamp of the data.
The queue block holds particles until they are demanded by an event
at the demand input.  The time stamp of the output will be equal to
that of the demand input, which may be delayed relative to the arrival
of an input.  So unlike a geodesic, the queue can introduce time delay.
Furthermore, the Queue block
provides a mechanism for simulating the effects of queues
with bounded size.
And it provides a mechanism for easily monitoring the amount of
data in a queue.
