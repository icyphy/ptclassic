A Poisson counting process is sent through one path (the "false" path)
until time 10.0, and through another path (the "true" path) after that.
The
.c Switch
star is used to perform the routing.
It's control is generated by a clock feeding a
.c FloatRamp
star.
Notice that the output of type \fIfloat\fR is connected
to the control input of type \fIint\fR.
The automatic type conversion truncates the floating point number,
removing the fractional part.
Thus, until the output of the
.c FloatRamp
exceeds 1.0, the control input of the
.c Switch
is 0.
A control input of zero routes input events through the lower ("false")
output, while any other control input routes events through the upper
("true") path.
