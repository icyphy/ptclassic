Demonstrate shared media communication without graphical connectivity,
using EtherSend and EtherRec stars.  Two clusters on the left transmit
to two clusters on the right over two distinct media, radio and infrared.
The communication is implemented using shared data structures between the stars.

The
.c EtherSend
and
.c EtherRec
stars are derived from a common base class,
.c Ether.
The base class implements a shared data structure that maintains
a directory to all stars derived from the base class, indexed by the
medium that they share.
In this demonstration, two media are used by each of two
.c EtherSend
stars, called "radio900MHz" and "infrared".
A total of six receivers, three for each medium, are also implemented.
