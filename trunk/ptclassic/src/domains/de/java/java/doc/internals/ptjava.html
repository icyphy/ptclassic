<H3>Why do the Java files go in a separate directory?</H3>

 <P>The Java files for the DE domain go in 
<CODE>$PTOLEMY/src/domains/de/java/java</CODE>
so that we can use the Tycho tycommon.mk makefile, which includes
rules for Java.

 <P>It would be nice if the Java files went in the stars directory, so
that they were local to the sources, but then we could not use
tycommon.mk, since tycommon.mk is not compatible with the older
Ptolemy makefile structure

 <P>We also do not want to pollute the <CODE>ptolemy/tycho/java</CODE>
directory with these old style Java classes that are based on a C++ star library and the JNI.

 <P>These Java classes should eventually go away, so they should not
corrupt Tycho. 
 
 <P>Note that the .class files are not platform dependent, so they should
not be built in <CODE>obj.$PTARCH/domains/de</CODE> tree.

<H3>What about CLASSPATH?</H3>

CLASSPATH is a major hack in Java.  

 <P>It is up to the star writer to ensure that CLASSPATH is set properly.
It seems to me that there are at least two ways to do this:

<OL>
<LI> In the Tcl script associated with the tyjni interface, set the
CLASSPATH


<LI> In the C code that starts up the Java VM, set the CLASSPATH.

 <br>The <CODE>jnicreatejvm</CODE> Tcl function defined in
<CODE>libtyjni</CODE> takes an optional argument that is the
<CODE>CLASSPATH</CODE>
</OL>


<H2>Compile Time Issues</H2>

Note that because we use the Tycho tyjni interface,
we don't have to have Java present to link in these stars.
However, Java does need to be present at runtime
