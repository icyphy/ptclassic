Print the value of each arriving event, together with its time of arrival.
The "fileName" parameter specifies the file to be written;
the special names <stdout> and <cout> (specifying the standard output stream),
and <stderr> and <cerr> specifying the standard error stream, are also supported.

The input may be a particle of any type.  The print() method
of the particle is used to generate the output.
If output is directed to a file, flushing does not occur until the
wrapup method is called.  Before the first data are flushed, the file
will not even exist.  This is normal.
