 This demo models the plucking of three strings; each string is modeled
by an instance of the galaxy karplusStrongGal.
.pp
 The Karplus-Strong algorithm models a string as a tapped delay line.
 The initial state of the string is determined by the IIDGaussian source
and is random.
 The FIR filter in the feedback loop is a lowpass filter, so high-frequency
energy is selectively reduced.  
.pp
 The initial burst yields the fairly broad spectrum characteristic of the
onset of a complex sound, with high frequencies being dominant.
 Relative to the fundamental and second harmonic, the higher frequencies
die out fairly rapidly, so that the underlying lower tones prevail in the end.
