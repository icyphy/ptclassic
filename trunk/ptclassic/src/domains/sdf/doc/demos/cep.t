Given the coefficients of a polynomial, this demo uses the cepstrum to
find a minimum-phase polynomial.
Thus, given the coefficients of the denominator polynomial of an unstable
filter, this demo will compute the coefficients of a stable denominator
polynomial that has the same magnitude frequency response.

Given a filter
.EQ
H(z) ~=~ { sum from n=0 to q b(n) z sup -n } over
{sum from n=0 to p a(n) z sup -n } ~=~ B(z) over A(z) ~,

this demo serves as a tool to determine whether the filter is stable.
If the filter is not stable, we wish to find a denominator $A sub s (z)$
that is causal and stable and is equal to $|A(z)|$ on the unit circle.
The filter $H sub s (z) ~=~ B(z)/A sub s (z)$ will therefore evaluate to
the same values as $H(z)$ on the unit circle.
Hence, in some sense, it has the frequency response that the unstable
filter should have had.
.pp
This problem depends only on the $a(n)$ (we assume that roots
of $A(z)$ and $B(z)$ do not cancel, so only the parameters $a(n)$
are provided as inputs.
We have to find the minimum phase signal $a sub s (n)$ that has the same
magnitude spectrum as $a (n)$.
.pp
The demo has a "universe parameter",
.i ncoefs.
The parameter
.i ncoefs
should be set greater than or equal to the number
of coefficients in $a(n)$ (including the 0'th coefficient).
Since 256-point FFT's are used, for good results
.i ncoefs
should be a good deal smaller than this.
.pp
The input coefficients are supplied as the
.i value
parameter of the
.c WaveForm
star on the far left.
To read the parameters from a file instead, give "< filename" as the
parameter value.
The values are the coefficients of $a(n)$, starting with $a(0)$.
.pp
The cepstrum of the autocorrelation function is computed and plotted.
This signal is multiplied by a window function.
This window function should have value 1/2 for $n ~=~ 0$, unity for $n ~>~ 0$,
and zero for $n ~<~ 0$, where $n$ is the time index; however, the cepstrum
"wraps around" (negative time appears above positive time because of
the periodicity of the DFT) so the application must compensate for this.
The resulting signal is the cepstrum of a minimum phase signal
$a hat sub s(n)$, and it can be shown that the autocorrelation of
$a sub s(n)$ is the same as the autocorrelation of $a(n)$.
So, we convert it from the cepstrum domain back to the time domain to
obtain our result.
.pp
The original signal is plotted in red; the modified signal is
plotted in green.
If the original signal was minimum phase (equivalently, if the original
filter was stable) you will see only one plot.
