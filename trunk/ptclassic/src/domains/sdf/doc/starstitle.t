.TI "SDF Stars"
.pp
The source code for all standard SDF stars is
in ~ptolemy/src/domains/sdf/stars.
By "standard" we mean the stars that are owned by \*(PT.
Because of their large number, their icons are divided into
three palettes accessible through the pigi main menu.
The "main" palette is identified
as ~ptolemy/src/domains/sdf/icons/main.pal, and contains
the most commonly used SDF functions.
.Id "SDF main palette"
.Id "palette, SDF main"
.Id "main palette, SDF"
The "dsp" palette is identified
as ~ptolemy/src/domains/dsp/icons/dsp.pal, and contains
more esoteric and specialized signal processing functions.
.Id "SDF dsp palette"
.Id "palette, SDF dsp"
.Id "dsp palette, SDF"
The "image" palette is identified
as ~ptolemy/src/domains/dsp/icons/image.pal, and contains
stars dedicated to image display and processing.
.Id "SDF image palette"
.Id "palette, SDF image"
.Id "image palette, SDF"
In this section, all stars in the three palettes are listed,
and the only distinction made between them is their "location".
.pp
Note that any star library in \*(PT should be viewed as a set of
examples, not as an all inclusive set.
Adding new stars is easy, so the library tends to contain only
stars for which we have encountered a need.
Most users will want to add their own.
