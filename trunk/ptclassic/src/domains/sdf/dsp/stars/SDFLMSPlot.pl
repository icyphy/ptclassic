OBSOLETE: THIS STAR IS REPLACED BY SDF LMSTkPlot.
Adaptive filter using LMS adaptation algorithm.  In addition,
the tap coefficients are plotted using the xgraph program, with a
separate plot for the magnitude and phase.  If "trace" is NO, only the
final tap values are plotted; if it is YES, a trace of each tap is
plotted as it adapts.

	explanation {
This star is exactly like the LMS star, except that, in addition,
it makes a plot of the tap coefficients.
.Id "adaptive filter with coefficient plotting"
.Id "filter, adaptive, with coefficient plotting"
.Id "filter, LMS, with coefficient plotting"
.Id "LMS adaptive filter with coefficient plotting"
It can produce two types
of plots: a plot of the final tap values or a plot that traces the
time evolution of each tap value: the time evolution is obtained
if \fItrace\fP is YES.
.lp
\fIgraphTitle\fP is used for the title of the plot; \fIgraphOptions\fP
is handed to the xgraph program as option values on the command line.
.lp
If \fItrace\fP is YES, there may not be more than 64 taps in the filter.
