Create a reachability matrix; it is required by the APGAN function

@Description 
The reachability matrix R is an NxN matrix, where N = #of nodes
in the SDF graph, such that R(i,j) = 1 iff there is a directed
path from node i to node j in the SDF graph.  R(i,j) = 0 otherwise.
<p>
We use a very simple algorithm to compute this matrix here; there
are probably faster algorithms around (notably, Strassen's algorithm
for multiplying 2 NxN matrices in O(lg(N)*N^2.81) time is asymptotically
better than the O(N^3) algorithm used here).
<p>
For each node i, we do a depth-first search from i and set those
entries R(i,j) to 1 for which j gets visted during the search.
Starting from a source node, we will visit every edge and node in
the subgraph that can be reached from that source node.  For each
edge, there is a potential O(N) update step when the reachability
matrix is updated.  Hence, if V_i,E_i is the set of nodes and edges
visited from a source node i, the total time is O( (|E_i|+|V_i|)*N )
starting from that source node.  Since a node is not visited again if
it has been visited already, we will only visit all the subgraphs that
form a disjoint union of the graph.
Adding up over the source nodes just gives the total running time of
O(|E|*N+|V|*N) = O(N^3) in general.
<p>
However, most practical acyclic SDF graphs are sparse; hence, O(N^2)
is more realistic.

@SideEffects
Creates <code>reachMatrix</code> a class data member.
Also, uses <code>flags[1]</code> for marking nodes.

Create an incidence matrix representation of the universe

@Description
Create an incidence matrix representation.  This representation
has the following form:  it is an NxN matrix Inc, where N is number
of nodes.  The (i,j)th element of the matrix represents the numbe
of tokens produced by node i on arc (i,j).
<p>
If Inc(i,j) > 0, then i produces Inc(i,j) tokens per firing on arc (i,j).
Del(i,j) is the number of delays on arc (i,j)
<p>
We do not need
the numbers consumed here since we already know the repetitions vector.
Also, since we can have a multi-graph, we collapse multiple
arcs into one arc here.  This is fine since this matrix is
used to compute buffering costs so an equivalent arc with the
correct numbers will be identical in cost to multiple arcs.

@SideEffects Creates incMatrix, delMatrix, and nodelist, three class data
members

Copy the flag value of the first cluster inside this cluster to its flags

@Description
The following function steps through each cluster inside gr and sets
flags[flagLocation] for that cluster by the value of flags[flagLocation]
for the head() of that cluster.  When all of the clusters in gr are
atomic; i.e, each has exactly one Star, this function's action simply
results in the flag value of the Star being propagated to its cluster
wrapper.  Hence, this function is usually called after a cluster hierarchy
has been set up using <code>Cluster::initializeForClustering</code>
so that things like node numbering can be kept consistent in the Cluster
hierarchy as well.

Cluster all spliced-stars together with their source or sink.

@Description
The following function an unfortunate hack needed because in the CG
domains, type-conversion and LinToCirc/CircToLin stars get spliced in
BEFORE the schedule is computed.  We perform a clustering step here to
ensure that these stars stay together with their source/sink so that
they end up in the innermost loops of the looped schedule.  It turns out
that clustering two actors A(a)--->(b)B(b) where a=b does not harm the
objective of buffer minimization.  Since type conversion and LinToCirc/
CircToLin stars are like B, this preprocessing step will work for any
spliced star currently used.  Hence, the function below clusters together
actors like B (that produce and consume the same amount as the source
or sink that B is connected to) with their source/sink and does not need
to explicitly check for spliced-in stars (since they are like B).

We use a very simple algorithm to compute this matrix here; there
are probably faster algorithms around (notably, Strassen's algorithm
for multiplying 2 NxN matrices in O(N^2.81) time is asymptotically
better than the O(N^3) algorithm used here).
For each node i, we do a breadth-first search from i and set those
entries R(i,j) to 1 for which j gets visted during the search.
We do this for every node in the graph.  Since every node and edge
could be visited during the search from i, the running time is
O(N+E) for one node.  Since there are N nodes, the time is
O(N(N+E)) = O(N^2 + N*E) = O(N^3) in the worst case.  However, most
practical acyclic SDF graphs are sparse; hence, O(N^2) is more realistic.
