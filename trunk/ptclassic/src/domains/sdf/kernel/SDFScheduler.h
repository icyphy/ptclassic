	// The deferredFiring option tries to put off the firing of
	// any block as long as possible.  The motivation is to minimize
	// the buffer sizes, to maximize the effectiveness of static
	// buffering.  On each pass, a block is
	// deferred until after the pass has been completed if any
	// block that it feeds data to can be fired.

	// It is deferred until some future pass if one of its output
	// Geodesics already have enough data to satisfy the destination
