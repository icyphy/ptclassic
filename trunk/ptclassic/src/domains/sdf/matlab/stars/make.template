# Makefile for Ptolemy SDF matlab/stars
# Author: Christopher Hylands
# $Id$
#
# We build two libraries:  libsdfmatlab and libsdfnomatlab.
# libsdfmatlab contains unresolved symbols that are resolved by the matlab
# library libmat.a.
# libsdfnomatlab contains no unresolved symbols, the stars inside it merely
# bring up windows stating that you must compile Ptolemy with matlab.
#
# If this file's name is "make.template" and there is no makefile in
# this directory, do
#	cp make.template makefile
#	chmod +w makefile
#	make depend
# This will add the dependencies to the makefile.
