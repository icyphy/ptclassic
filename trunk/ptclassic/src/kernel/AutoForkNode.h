 This glass is a Geodesic that automatically generates auto-forks
 when attempts are made to connect multiple outputs to it.  It forbids
 the specification of multiple inputs.

 Change: the auto-forking is moved into a separate class called AutoFork,
 so we can make other types of auto-forking geodesics with greater ease.
