 A FixArrayState is conceptually represented as an array of fixed
 point numbers.  Legal values for elements range from -1 to just under 1
 (an exact one is allowed and converted to the largest possible
 fixed point number).

 Its initialization expression can have arbitrary floating values,
 as long as the final value for each element is within the [-1,1] range.

 bitVal(int el, int nBits) returns the value, as an n-bit 2's complement
 integer, of the el'th element.

 nBits can be no more than the number of bits in a long.
