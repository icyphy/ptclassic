 An InterpUniverse is an Universe with an interpreted galaxy
 in it.  This is accomplished by making it Runnable and an InterpGalaxy.
 This is the main object that interfaces talk to that makes Ptolemy
 work.

 There used to be two slightly different versions of this, one
 in pigiRpc/kernelCalls.h and one in Interpreter.h.  Now there is
 one file.
