The KnownBlock class.

This class provides a list of all known blocks.  There is a separate
list for each domain (corresponding to blocks that may be run by
a specific scheduler).

The idea is that each star or galaxy that is "known to the system"
should add an instance of itself to the known list by code something
like

static MyType proto;
static KnownBlock entry(proto,"MyType");

Then the static method KnownBlock::clone(name, dom) can produce a new
instance of the named class in the named domain.  As for blocks,
clone copies everything, makeNew just makes a new one.

KnownBlock::defaultDomain() returns the default domain name.  This is
not used internally for anything; it is just set to the first domain
seen during the building of known lists.

validDomain() returns TRUE if the argument is a valid domain.

We no longer have the concept of the "current domain".  We used to use
the "current domain" and repeatedly changed it; this is now going away
since it is troublesome, especially with multiple threads or with an X
interface where the flow of control is hard to follow.
