// PtGate is an abstract baseclass; derived classes typically provide the
// desired semantics for use with a particular threads library (such
// as Sun lightweight processes, Posix threads, etc.  The PtGate object
// provides a "lock" and an "unlock" primitive.  Also, "makeNew" is a sort
// of virtual constructor, permitting more PtGate objects of the same type to
// be constructed given a prototype.

};

// A CriticalSection object is used only for the side effects of its
// constructor and destructor.  The constructor optionally sets the lock
// and the destructor releases it; the effect is that, if the PtGate pointer
// is non-null, measures will be taken to ensure that only one section of
// code controlled by a given PtGate is active at once.

// Multithreading performance is best if code regions protected by a
// CriticalSection are short.  It is assumed that the PtGate object will
// never be deleted during the lifetime of the CriticalSection.
