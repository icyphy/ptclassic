/*
 * This routine looks for the property `prop' by `name' under
 * `container'.  If `container' is `inst' or an actual terminal
 * of `inst',  the filled in property is returned and the routine
 * returns OCT_OK.  If the property is not found,  the routine
 * searches the master (or formal terminal) of the instance for
 * the property and returns its value if found.  The `facet'
 * parameter specifies what facet of the master is opened for the
 * master or formal terminal search.  If no object is found,  the
 * routine returns OCT_NOT_FOUND.  In any case, the name field of
 * `prop' is modified to point to `name'.
 *
 * If `container' is the master of `inst' or a formal terminal of
 * the master of `inst',  the search is actually carried out
 * assuming `container' is the associated container on the
 * instance.  The semantics are the same as those described
 * above.
 *
 * If `container' is neither `inst', an actual terminal of
 * `inst',  the master of `inst',  or a formal terminal of the
 * master of `inst',  the routine behaves exactly like
 * octGetByName(container, prop).
 *
 * In effect,  lelFindProp evaluates a property in the context of
 * a design hierarchy.  It implements the policy that the value
 * of a property in a master cell is overridden by the value of
 * the same property on an instance of that cell.  If the instance
 * in the hierarchy is unknown, a zero may be specified for it.
