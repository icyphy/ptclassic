/* 
 * To avoid dangling pointers in generators, each object keeps a 
 * reference count of generators that current point toward it.  When 
 * an object with a non-zero reference count is deleted or detached, a
 * list of all active generators in the object's facet is searched for generators 
 * that point to that object.  Those generators are moved past the 
 * offending object so no dangling references are left.  The reference 
 * count lets us search that list of active generators only for 
 * objects that are actually being referenced. Since it is
 * unlikely that several generators will be simultaneously pointing to 
 * the same object, the ref_count field is only 2 bits deep.  If the 
 * count overflows that field (i.e. becomes larger than REF_MANY), it 
 * is set permanently to REF_MANY.  In this rare case, there will be a 
 * perhaps un-neccessary search of the active generators when that 
 * object is deleted  or detached
