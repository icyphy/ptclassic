 *
 * Maxport is a subclass of the Athena Viewport widget that allows
 * the caller to specify a maximum width and height.  This is useful
 * if you have a child widget that starts out very large and you
 * would like to force the viewport to scroll initially.
 *
 * These are the private definitions for subclassing the class.
