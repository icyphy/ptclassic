This program is a version of octmvlib that has been customized for use
with Ptolemy.  Formerly, to modify and remake this program, you need
to have the octtools installed in ~octtools.  Now, you need to have
the octtools libraries installed in $PTOLEMY/octtools/lib.$ARCH and
the include files must be available in $PTOLEMY/src/vem/include.

The program should be used whenever icons used in a particular facet
have been moved.  For instance, if after developing a useful star,
the star is installed in a location available to all users.
The program can also be used whenever a facet has an invalid icon
(the icon cannot be found).

To run it interactively, simply type:

masters facet(s)

You will be prompted for a pathname to replace. If you enter a
question mark, the pathnames in the facet will be listed, with
invalid pathnames highlighted.
The same replacements will be made on the all facets specified on
the command line.
