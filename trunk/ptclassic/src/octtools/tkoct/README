README for src/tkvem

This is a prototype of a tcltk version of vem.  Kennard White did most
of the programming.

restrictive copyrights.

tkAux is an auxiliary library for tk.  tkvem calls this library from
ged.tcl 



Currently tkvem reads in ged.tcl at startup.  tkvem uses the PTOLEMY
environment variable to find $PTOLEMY/src/tkvem/tkvem/ged.tcl.
Eventually this file should be moved in with the other tcltk lib
files, but for the time being it should stay here.  It would be nice
if, upon startup, tkvem would load a ged.tcl file in the current
directory, if it exists.  If ged.tcl does not exist in the current
directory, then it could load up the library version.

Bugs:	
	- Can't edit
	- Copyrighted too tightly for full distribution
	- Can't look inside icons that are actually text files.
