 * VEM Dialog Manager Interface Routines

 *
 * This file contains easy to use programming interfaces for common
 * dialog operations.  These are usually short moded dialogs which
 * ask questions that require an answer immediately.  The prefix of
 * these routines is "dm".
 *
 * This package is now implemented on top of the more powerful
 * Xt toolkit based package "dds".  It is provided for
 * compatibility.  The library must be initialized using
 * dmCompatInit().
 *
 * The routines defined here are internal for use by the rest of
 * the package.
