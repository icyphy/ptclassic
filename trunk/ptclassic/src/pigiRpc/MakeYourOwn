How to make your own personal pigiRpc
$Id$

pigi's ability to dynamically link in stars has limitations; you can't
link in new libraries or have one dynamically linked star be derived
from another dynamically linked star.  Also, you cannot dynamically link
in a new domain.  To get around those limitations, you can build your
own pigiRpc executable.  To use the executable, set the environment
variable PIGIRPC to the full path of your personal pigiRpc executable.

To build your own pigiRpc, you should create a working directory, and
copy the makefile and defpalettes.c from this directory to your working
directory.  Edit defpalettes.c to reflect the default domain and list
of palettes that you desire, and edit the makefile to modify what stars
and libraries are linked into the executable.  Then run "make" and you're
in business.

WARNING: make sure to modify the place where "make install" puts the
completed executable, or it will attempt to overwrite the official
pigiRpc, and people may be upset at you if you succeed in doing that.
