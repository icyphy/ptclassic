src/tcl/README

This directory contains the source to tcl/tk for the Ptolemy
release. If you have the Ptolemy binary release, you need not install
tcl/tk from this directory.

Probably the only time you would want to build from this directory is
if you were doing a Ptolemy port to a new platform.

You should be able to build tcl and tk from the top level Ptolemy
directory.  You will need to set the $PTOLEMY and $PTARCH variables:
	setenv PTOLEMY /users/ptolemy
	cd $PTOLEMY
	setenv PTARCH sun4
	make install_tcltk	

The makefile $PTOLEMY/mk/scratch-srcs.mk has rules to build tcl and
tk. 

Most of the sources in this directory are available via anonymous ftp
from ftp.cs.berkeley.edu in ucb/tcl/.  The TkPixmap is available via
anonymous ftp from harbor.ecn.purdue.edu in pub/tcl/extensions

You may use your own tcltk even if it does not have TkPixmap installed
in it.  The program 'xpole' uses TkPixmap.  xpole is not part of
Ptolemy, but it is available via anonymous ftp from
ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu in the pub/misc directory.

If you chose to use your own tcltk, you will need to either
1) Edit $PTOLEMY/mk/config-default.mk and change the TCL_ROOT,
   TCL_INCDIR, TCL_LIBSPEC, TK_INCDIR AND TK_LIBSPEC.
or
2) make links in $PTOLEMY/tcltk/*

Versions
--------
	Ptolemy 0.5 uses tcl7.3 and tk3.6.
	tk3.6 has had the following patches applied:
		tk3.6p1 patch
	TkPixmap3.6e is necessary for xpole, but not for Ptolemy in
	general.


GNU make
--------
	If you are compiling from scratch, make sure that you are
	using GNU make.  Not all versions of make can deal with VPATH.
	You should install the GNU tools first, then make sure that
	$PTOLEMY/bin.$PTARCH is in your path.

DEC
---
	If you are compiling on a DEC mips, then you might not have
	strdup().  xpm requires strdup.
	If your system does not have strdup(), use the following:
	make XPM_DEFINES="-DZPIPE -DNEED_STRDUP"
