src/tcl/README

This directory contains the source to tcl/tk for the Ptolemy
release. If you have the Ptolemy binary release, you need not install
tcl/tk from this directory.

Probably the only time you would want to build from this directory is
if you were doing a Ptolemy port to a new platform.

Most of the sources in this directory are available via anonymous ftp from
ftp.cs.berkeley.edu in ucb/tcl/.  The TkPixmap is available via
anonymous ftp from harbor.ecn.purdue.edu in pub/tcl/extensions

Versions
--------
	Ptolemy 0.5 uses tcl7.3 and tk3.6.
	tk3.6 has had the following patches applied:
		tk3.6p1 patch
	TkPixmap3.6a is necessary for xpole, and to get the Mr Ptolemy
	face in the welcome window.

GNU make
--------
	If you are compiling from scratch, make sure that you are
	using GNU make.  Not all versions of make can deal with VPATH.
	You should install the GNU tools first, then make sure that
	$PTOLEMY/bin.$ARCH is in your path.

DEC
---
	If you are compiling on a DEC mips, then you might not have
	strdup().  xpm requires strdup.
	If your system does not have strdup(), use the following:
	make XPM_DEFINES="-DZPIPE -DNEED_STRDUP"
