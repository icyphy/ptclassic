There is also a Pthreads mailing list distributing information about
new releases, bug patches and related issues. You can subscribe to the
mailing list either
- by sending e-mail to "mueller@informatik.hu-berlin.de" with the
  subject line "subscribe-pthreads". [If your local mailer inserts an incorrect
  return address, send mail message with a different subject and include
  your correct e-mail address.]

As part of the PART project we have been designing and implementing a
library package of preemptive threads which is compliant with POSIX
1003.4a Draft 6. A description of the interface for our Pthreads
library is also available on ftp. Our implementation is limited to the
Sun SPARC architecture and SunOS 4.1.x or Solaris. We do not make any
use of Sun's light-weight processes to achieve better performance
(with one I/O-related exception).

What's NEW:

  .port to DOS under DJGPP v2
   (thanks to David Rose <rose@cs.fsu.edu> for the port,
    rupp@gnat.com (Doug Rupp) for packing and more,
    and to Ton Biegstraaten <A.W.W.M.Biegstraaten@twi.tudelft.nl> for testing)

  .bug fix: Solaris compile for DEF_RR, IO and MALLOC failed
   (problem by: Adam Wierzbicki <adamw@icm.edu.pl>)
  .bug fix: Intel platform mutex.c needs -O0, o/w runtime error
   due to gcc 2.7.2 bug
  .bug fix: SunOS, linux: signal handlers report fault addr for SEGV/BUS
   had compilation problems

The following features are included in the current implementation:
-from POSIX.4a:
  .thread management: initializing, creating, joining, exiting, and
   destroying threads
  .synchronization: mutual exclusion, condition variables
  .thread-specific data
  .thread priority scheduling: priority management, preemptive
   priority scheduling (FIFO, RR),
   mutex priority ceilings through stack resource policy (SRP)
  .signals: signal handlers, synchronous and asynchronous wait for
   signals, masking and sending of signals, sleep, long jumps
  .cancellation: cleanup handlers, asynchronous, synchronous, and
   disabled interruptability.
-from POSIX.4:
  .timers: nanosleep, read clock, priority scheduling bounds
-from POSIX.1:
  .synchronous I/O for threads (I/O only blocks current thread, not process)
-others:
  .perverted scheduling for debugging (MUT_SWITCH, RR_SWITCH, RAND_SWITCH)
  .stack overflow check causes signal (optional STACK_CHECK)
  .graceful handling of stack overflow (optional SIGNAL_STACK)
  .repeated inclusion of header files prevented

The support is currently being extended to include:
-from POSIX.4a:
  .draft 10 upgrade
  .mutex priority inheritance / priority ceiling emulation protocol
  .reentrant functions
  .process control: fork, wait, waitpid
   (The above functions are not supported for threads. Their semantics
    is whatever UNIX semantics for processes is. Consequently, a fork
    will fork another process with ALL threads being duplicated, not
    just the executing thread as required by POSIX.4a.
    The functions exec and _exit behave as required without any
    change, i.e. the UNIX process level semantics for these functions
    is also adequate for threads.)
-from POSIX.4:
  .asynchronous I/O for threads
  .asynchronous timer objects
-other:
  .heap memory pools

The current scheduling policies are strict priority scheduling
(according to POSIX.4a FIFO scheduling) which preempts when signals
are caught or round-robin (RR scheduling) which changes context to
another thread of the same priority after a time-slice of 20msec.
Besides asynchronous delivery of signals, context switches only occur
where required by the priority policy, e.g. when resources (mutexes)
are locked etc.

"The current implementation has been tested and used as a base to
implement the GNu Ada Runtime Library (GNARL) for the Gnu NYU Ada
Translator (GNAT, see ftp://ftp.cs.nyu.edu/pub/gnat/).  But we do not
make any claims about the completeness or correctness of this
implementation.
