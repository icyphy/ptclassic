<H1>Ptolemy Test Bed</H1>
Last Modified: %D%

<H2>Overview of the Ptolemy test bed</H2>

There are several different levels of testing that can be done:
<OL>
<LI> <A HREF="#Run the octtools tests">Run the octtools tests</A>

<LI> <A HREF="#Run all the demos from the graphical interface">Run all
	the demos from the graphical interface</A>

<LI> <A HREF="#Run the incremental linking test suite">Run the
	incremental linking test suite</A>

<LI> <A HREF="#Run most of the demos with out windows">Run most of the
	demos with out windows</A>
</OL>

<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Run the octtools tests"></A>Run the octtools tests</H2>
	Some of the octtools subdirectories have tests.  The tests are
	not very well documented, but if you are doing a port to a new
	architecture, it is worth running them.

	 <P>Here's how:
	<OL>
	<LI> Build the octtools libraries: <CODE>cd $PTOLEMY; make
	install_octtools</CODE>

	<LI> Run the tests: <CODE>cd $PTOLEMY/obj.$PTARCH/octtools;
	make tests</CODE>
	</OL>

<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Run all the demos from the graphical interface"></A>Run
all the demos from the graphical interface</H2>

	This test is run by hand, and is not directly part of the
	Ptolemy test bed.  One trick is to run a script that kills any
	windows that are brought up.  $PTOLEMY/src/tst/killpxgraph
	will run ps and kill pxgraph, xedit and xv processes that
	start up.

	 <P>Here's the general idea:
	<OL>
	<LI> Start up killpxgraph: <CODE>$PTOLEMY/src/tst/killpxgraph &</CODE>

	<LI> Start up pigi, and when then bring up the Ptolemy menu by
	depressing shift and the middle-mouse button.  The select the
	<CODE>Exec</CODE> sub-menu and the <CODE>Run All Demos</CODE> choice.
	</OL>
	 <P>All the demos will run.  You will need to kill tk boxes that
	come up.

	<H3>Do we dump core?</H3>
	If you use the default pigiRpc, about the only thing this test
	checks for is whether or not we dump core, or otherwise
	ungraciously exit.  If you are familiar enough with the demos,
	you might notice inconsistencies in the output.

	<H3>Does purify report anything grim?</H3>

	If you build a pigiRpc that has purify in it, you can check
	for memory leaks etc:
	<LISTING>
		cd $PTOLEMY/obj.$PTARCH/pigiRpc; make pigiRpc.debug.purify
		cd $PTOLEMY; pigi
	</LISTING>

	
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Run the incremental linking test suite"></A>Run the
	incremental linking test suite </H2>

	<CODE>$PTOLEMY/src/tst/incLink</CODE>
	 contains an incremental linking
	testsuite.  You can run it by cding to
	<CODE>$PTOLEMY/obj.$PTARCH/tst/incLink</CODE>
	and typing <CODE>make test</CODE>.

<HR>

<H2><A NAME="Run most of the demos with out windows"></A>Run most of
	the demos with out windows</H2>

	<CODE>$PTOLEMY/src/tst</CODE> contains a testbed that will run
	many of the demos and compare the results against known results.
	The <CODE>$PTOLEMY/MAKEARCH</CODE> script will produce a directory
	tree under $PTOLEMY/obj.$PTARCH/tst if $PTOLEMY/src/tst is
	present when <CODE>MAKEARCH</CODE> is run
	
	 <P>Running this testbed is similar to doing a run-all-demos
	as above, but you don't need the window system running.
	However, not all demos are run.  We use Kennard White's
	<CODE>oct2ptcl</CODE> program to translate oct facets to ptcl
	scripts.

<H4>Oct2tpcl limitations</H4>

	We can use the <CODE>oct2tpcl -t</CODE> option to skip
	producing ptcl code for any facets that use Tk widgets because
	to test these, the window system must be running, and the user
	must mouse on the tk windows.  Or, we can define TclTk stars
	that take the same parameters that dump their output to files
	or to stdout.  See <CODE>mdsdf/stars</CODE> for example code.

	 <P><CODE>oct2tpcl</CODE> more precisely follows the oct
	standard than other parts of Ptolemy, so <CODE>oct2tpcl</CODE>
	will reject some facets that work fine under Ptolemy.  Usually
	the problem is an instance of a star that was removed and a
	galaxy was substituted in.  The fix is to remove the galaxy
	instance from the facet and then to replace it with the same
	galaxy.  This often fixes the formalIds.

	
<H4><CODE>pxgraph</CODE> limitations</H4>

	<CODE>$PTOLEMY/src/tst/makefile</CODE> contains rules to run
	all the tests.  The basic idea is that we use
	<CODE>oct2tpcl</CODE> to generate ptcl code which we run on
	ptcl.  To graph the output we use a <CODE>pxgraph</CODE>
	script rather than the <CODE>pxgraph</CODE> binary which
	brings up windows.  We set the path specially in the
	<CODE>makefile</CODE> for the following reasons:

	<MENU>
	
	<LI> Don't use <CODE>$PTOLEMY/bin/ptcl</CODE>, as it places
	<CODE>$PTOLEMY/bin.$PTARCH</CODE> and <CODE>$PTOLEMY</CODE> in
	your path first, thus you get the regular <CODE>pxgraph</CODE>
	instead of our <CODE>pxgraph</CODE>.  You should run
	<CODE>$PTOLEMY/bin.$PTARCH/ptcl</CODE>
	or
	<CODE>$PTOLEMY/obj.$PTARCH/ptcl/ptcl.debug.purify</CODE>
	
	<LI> Set your path so that you get the right <CODE>pxgraph</CODE>:
	<CODE>set path = ($PTOLEMY/src/tst $path)</CODE>
	</MENU>

<H4>Output filename limitations</H4>
	
	Our script version of <CODE>pxgraph</CODE> tries to generate a
	reasonable filename for the data.  If a file name
	<CODE>pxfilename</CODE> is present in the current directory,
	then we read <CODE>pxfilename</CODE> in and use the contents
	as part of the output file name.

	We try to grab the title of the graph from the -t option.  We
	substitute in underbars for spaces, so -t "a big graph" would
	become a_big_graph.  Note that other special characters are
	not at this time checked for.

	If a graph consists of multiple data sets spread over multiple
	files, then each file will have a number after it.

	Note that there could be a race condition if two
	<CODE>pxgraph</CODE>s are trying to write files at once.
	Currently, we test to see if the file we want to write exists,
	and if it does, we don't write it.  However, this will not
	always solve the race problem.  One solution would be to use
	part of the temporary filename that <CODE>pxgraph</CODE> is
	called with.  Another would be to introduce a 2 second delay
	between each universe run (<CODE>oct2tpcl</CODE> would need to
	be modified).

<H3>Regression testing</H3>

	Regression testing can defined as the act of comparing
	current output with output from the past that is known to be good.

	There are several several different types of demos that
	produce different types of output with regard to regression
	testing:

	<MENU>
	<LI> Demos that produce output that is always the same on all
	platforms.  These demos are said to be deterministic.  We
	can directly compare the results across platforms.

	
	<LI> Demos that are non-deterministic on all platforms.  We
	cannot compare the actual data, but we might be able to compare
	the number of data points produced.

	
	<LI> Demos that produce data that is very similar on all
	platforms, but is not exactly the same, probably because of
	word size or internal representation differences.  We cannot
	directly compare data across platforms, but we can use a script
	to verify that the data points are within a certain range.


	</MENU>

	To produce results and compare them against the 'known good'
	results, do
	<LISTING>
	cd $PTOLEMY/obj.$PTARCH/tst; make test; make diff
	</LISTING>

	 <P>To update the 'known good' results, do:
	<LISTING>
	cd $PTOLEMY/src/tst
	make test
	make updateresults
	</LISTING>

	<CODE>cd $PTOLEMY/src/tst</CODE>
<H3>Running with an old ptcl</H3>

	It is possible to run the test with an old ptcl by running
	<CODE>$PTOLEMY/src/tst/sbin/makeoldptcl</CODE> <I>/Your/Old/Ptolemy</I>
	<CODE>test</CODE>

	<H4>Causes of differences in results between old and new
	<CODE>ptcl</CODE>s</H4>

	<MENU>
	<LI> You will probably want to build the ptcl test code with
	the same <CODE>$PTOLEMY</CODE> that you used to build the
	master results file.  The demos are likely to have changed
	between versions of Ptolemy, so your results will be different.

	<LI> Some stars may be present in a newer <CODE>ptcl</CODE>, but 
	not in the older <CODE>ptcl</CODE>

	<LI> Bugs in the old <CODE>ptcl</CODE> may be fixed in the new
	version.
	</MENU>


<H3>Test Suite Bugs</H3>
	<MENU>
	<LI> The sdf/matlab demos bring up a matlab welcome window

	<LI> The sdf/audio demos want to write to /dev/audio.
		We should substitute in a star that just writes the output
		to a file
		You can run <CODE>audiotool</CODE> to turn down the volume.

	<LI> The following demos in ddf don't plot any data:
		fibonnacci, errorDemo, symmetric
	
	<LI> ddf demos do not produce the same output if you run the ptcl
		script produced by <CODE>oct2tpcl</CODE> or by compiling with pigi
		and reading ~/pigiLog.pt
	
	<LI> de:miscellaneous: a demo fails with:
	<LISTING>
		Error while defining: ERROR: No star/galaxy named
			'speechinv' in domain 'DE' 
	</LISTING>
	
	<LI> ptcl does not have dfm FileSource star		
	<LI> ptcl should be able to handle higher order functions
	
	<LI> If there are two universes in the same palette that have
	xgraph stars with the same titles, then the data can get mangled.
	The solution is to change the titles of the graphs.
