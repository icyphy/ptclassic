for key <a name=bindings>bindings</a>.

<h2>Generic Bindings</h2>
</a>
<p>
The following key bindings apply to virtually all interactive
text widgets in Tycho, including entry boxes in dialogs and
text widgets in editors.
<p>
<h3>Navigation</h3>
<p>
<dl COMPACT>
<b><dt>C-a</b><dd>go to the beginning of the line
<b><dt>C-b</b><dd>backward one character
<b><dt>M-b</b><dd>backward one word
<b><dt>C-e</b><dd>go to the end of the line
<b><dt>C-f</b><dd>forward one character
<b><dt>M-f</b><dd>forward one word
</dl>
<p>
<h3>Modifying text</h3>
<p>
Delete, C-h, and Backspace all erase the previous character,
unless there is a selection, in which case they erase the selection.
M-Delete, M-C-h, and M-Backspace behave the same way, except that
they erase a word at a time.  In addition, the following bindings apply:
<dl COMPACT>
<b><dt>C-d</b><dd>delete the next character
<b><dt>M-d</b><dd>forward erase one word
<b><dt>C-k</b><dd>erase to the end of the line (save to clipboard)
<b><dt>C-w</b><dd>erase the selection
<b><dt>M-w</b><dd>copy the selection to the clipboard
<b><dt>C-y</b><dd>yank from the clipboard and insert at cursor
<b><dt>C-/</b><dd>select the entire contents
<b><dt>C-&#92;</b><dd>clear any selection
</dl>
<p>
Commands that delete characters will save them to the
clipboard, so they can be recovered with C-y.
Any set of contiguous character deletions are collected
in the clipboard.
<p>
<a name="entry box bindings">
<h2>Bindings for Entry Boxes and Dialogs</h2>
</a>
<p>
Entry boxes have all the
<a href="#generic key bindings">generic bindings</a> plus one more:
<dl COMPACT>
<b><dt>C-u</b><dd>delete all the text in the entry box
</dl>
In addition, most dialog boxes support the following:
<dl COMPACT>
<b><dt>Escape</b><dd>dismiss the dialog, ignoring it
<b><dt>Return</b><dd>dismiss the dialog, executing whatever
<b><dt>Space</b><dd>invoke a button
<b><dt>Tab</b><dd>move from one item to another
</dl>
<p>
<a name="text editor bindings">
<h2>Bindings for Text Editors</h2>
</a>
<p>
Text editors (any multi-line editable text widget)
have all the <a href="#generic key bindings">generic bindings</a>
plus a few more.

<h3>Changing Text</h3>

<dl COMPACT>
<b><dt>C-o</b><dd>open a line of text below the insert cursor
<b><dt>C-x u</b><dd>undo the last change
<b><dt>M-q</b><dd>fill selected region or current paragraph
<b><dt>C-x f</b><dd>change the right column used for the fill
<b><dt>C-x .</b><dd>change the prefix characters used by the fill
</dl>
<p>
The fill capability requires some explanation.
<a name="filling text">
<h3>Filling Text</h3>
</a>
<p>
The "Fill Region" command fills text so that the lines
are approximately of equal length and line breaks occur
on word boundaries.  It can optionally add a prefix to
each filled line (for example a comment character), and
typically does so in language-specific editors, which are derived
from the basic editor. If a
region of text has been selected, then it fills that
region.  Otherwise, it fills the paragraph that contains
the insertion cursor.  A paragraph is bounded by a blank
line before and after, or possibly a line with only the comment
character.
<p>
<h3>Navigation</h3>
<p>
The emacs-like bindings for moving around in a multi-line
text widget are:
<dl COMPACT>
<b><dt>C-l</b><dd>center the insert cursor on the screen
<b><dt>C-n</b><dd>down one line
<b><dt>C-p</b><dd>up one line
<b><dt>C-r</b><dd>search backwards
<b><dt>C-s</b><dd>search forwards
<b><dt>C-v</b><dd>forward one page
<b><dt>M-v</b><dd>backward one page
<b><dt>M-&lt;</b><dd>move to the top of the document
<b><dt>M-&gt;</b><dd>move to the bottom of the document
</dl>
<p>
Other capabilities for moving around in a text document are
simply those implemented in the text widget in Tk.
Thus, the following documentation
is copied from the Tk text man page, written by John
Ousterhout, with only minor modifications.
Note that it is fairly common to redefine
some of these bindings in the window manager to perform
window manager functions.  In this case, Tycho will never
see the bindings, and they will not appear to work.
<p>
"The  Left  and Right keys move the insertion cursor one
character to the left or right;  they  also  clear  any
selection  in the text.  If Left or Right is typed with
the Shift key down, then the insertion cursor moves and
the selection is extended to include the new character.
Control-Left and Control-Right move the insertion  cursor
by  words,  and  Control-Shift-Left  and  Control-Shift-Right
move the insertion cursor by words and also
extend  the  selection.
<p>
The Up and Down keys move the insertion cursor one line
up or down and clear any selection in the text.  If  Up
or  Right  is  typed  with the Shift key down, then the
insertion cursor moves and the selection is extended to
include the new lines.  Control-Up and Control-Down
move the insertion  cursor  by  paragraphs  (groups  of
lines  separated  by blank lines), and Control-Shift-Up
and Control-Shift-Down move  the  insertion  cursor  by
paragraphs  and  also  extend the selection.
<p>
The  Next (Page up) and Prior (Page down) keys move the
insertion cursor forward or backwards by one  screenful
and clear any selection  in the text.  If the Shift key
is  held  down  while  Next or Prior is typed, then the
selection  is  extended to include  the new pages.
<p>
Home  and  Control-a  move  the insertion cursor to the
beginning of its line and clear any  selection  in  the
widget.   Shift-Home  moves the insertion cursor to the
beginning of the line and also extends the selection to
that point.
<p>
End  and Control-e move the insertion cursor to the end
of the line and clear  any  selection  in  the  widget.
Shift-End  moves  the cursor to the end of the line and
extends the selection to that point.
<p>
Control-Home  and  Meta-<  move the insertion cursor to
the beginning of the text and clear  any  selection  in
the  widget.   Control-Shift-Home  moves  the insertion
cursor to the beginning of the text  and  also  extends
the selection to that point.
<p>
Control-End and Meta-> move the insertion cursor to the
end of the text and clear any selection in the  widget.
Control-Shift-End  moves  the  cursor to the end of the
text and extends the selection to that point.
<p>
The F16 key (labeled Copy on many Sun workstations) or
Meta-w copies the selection in the widget to the  clipboard,
if there is a selection.
<p>
The  F20 key (labeled Cut on many Sun workstations) or
Control-w copies the selection in  the  widget  to  the
clipboard  and  deletes  the selection.  If there is no
selection in the widget then these keys have no effect.
<p>
The  F18  key (labeled Paste on many Sun workstations)
or Control-y inserts the contents of the  clipboard  at
the position of the insertion cursor."
<p>
<a name="mouse navigation">
<h2>Mouse Navigation</h2>
</a>
<p>
The interaction of the mouse with text is simply that
implemented in the text widget in Tk.  Thus, the following
documentation is again copied from the man page for
the text widget, written by John Ousterhout, with minor
editing.
<p>
"Pressing mouse button 1 in an text positions the insertion
cursor  just  before the character underneath the
mouse cursor and sets the input focus to this widget.
Dragging with mouse button 1 strokes  out  a  selection
between  the  insertion  cursor and the character under
the mouse.
<p>
If you double-click mouse button 1 then the word  under
the mouse cursor will be selected, the insertion cursor
will be positioned at the beginning of  the  word,  and
dragging  the  mouse  will stroke out a selection whole
words at a time.
[Note that in some derived classes, double clicking
activates a hypertext link.]
<p>
If you triple-click mouse button 1 then the line  under
the mouse cursor will be selected, the insertion cursor
will be positioned at the beginning of  the  line,  and
dragging  the  mouse  will stroke out a selection whole
line at a time.
<p>
The ends of the selection can be adjusted  by  dragging
with  mouse button 1 while the shift key is down;  this
will adjust the end of the selection that  was  nearest
to  the mouse cursor when button 1 was pressed.  If the
button is double-clicked before dragging then the selection
will be adjusted in units of whole words; if it is
triple-clicked, then the selection will be adjusted  in
units of whole lines.
<p>
Clicking  mouse button 1 with the Control key down will
reposition the insertion cursor without  affecting  the
selection.
<p>
The view in the widget can be adjusted by dragging with
mouse button 2.  If mouse button 2 is  clicked  without
moving the mouse, the selection is copied into the text
at the position of the insertion cursor. The Insert key
also inserts the selection.
