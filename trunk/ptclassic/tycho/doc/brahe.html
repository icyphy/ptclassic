<strong>Tycho Brahe,</strong> a Danish aristocrat turned astronomer,
invented a system in which the earth is stationary and the planets
revolve around the sun which, in turn, revolves around the earth. This
model replaced that of Ptolemy, which had the planets revolving around
the earth, with epicycles accounting for their retrograde motion. This
model was favored by most astronomers until the mid-seventeenth
century. It had the advantage of avoiding the problems introduced by
ascribing motion to the Earth, which was obviously not moving.

<p> Tycho Brahe's most important studies, however, concerned the
supernova of 1572, which appeared as a new star in the constellation
Cassiopeia. He argued that it was at a great distance from the earth,
and not merely a local phenomenon, using the absence of a parallax as
evidence. The star is now usually known as 'Tycho's supernova'. This
work, together with his observations of the comet of 1577, enabled him
to destroy the hypothesis of solid celestial spheres.

<p>

With financial help from the King of Denmark, he built an observatory
on the island of Hveen in Copenhagen Sound. The observatory, called
Uraniborg, was equipped with exceptionally large and accurate
instruments (and with an alchemical laboratory in its basement). At
Uraniborg Tycho made twenty years' worth of astronomical observations,
all without telescopes, which did not come into use until later.

<p> In 1599 he was appointed Imperial Mathematician to the Holy Roman
Emperor, Rudolph II, in Prague. Johannes Kepler (1571 -1630) joined him
as an assistant, to help with mathematical calculations. Kepler, unlike
Tycho, was a follower of Copernicus, who put the sun at the center of
the solar system.
