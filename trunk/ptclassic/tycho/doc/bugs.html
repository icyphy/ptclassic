<h1><a name="bugs in the kernel">Bugs in the kernel</a></h1>

<h3><a href="$TYCHO/kernel/MenuBar.itcl">MenuBar</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>If you add a menu with a name that already exists, and the
existing menu is before an entry that has no -label option
(such as a separator), then the add will fail with an error.
The reason is that the menubar uses the menu label as the
only way of accessing menu entries, and separators have no
label! The design is flawed, but it's probably not worth fixing
this until we find out what support Tk 8.0 has for menubars,
and using that.

</ul>

<h3><a href="$TYCHO/kernel/File.itcl">File</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>File names are being added to the list of open files,
but if the constructor subsequently fails, then Tycho
becomes incoherent. It looks like the File methods
used by openContext barf because a widget is in the file
index but doesn't exist.
</ul>

<h3><a href="$TYCHO/kernel/Displayer.itcl">Displayer</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The menu buttons created in MenuSupport and MenuBar may need to be
    made global (with an uplevel #0).
</ul>

<h3><a href="$TYCHO/kernel/Edit.itcl">Edit</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Fill region is much too slow.
<li>The undo in the text widgets is only one level deep.
<li>Meta-f, Meta-d do not skip over white space (a Tk "feature" -- need to
    override it).
<li>Need quick font-size control in the menus, like in HTML.
<li>Need a "find-again" binding, and perhaps emacs-style incremental search.
<li>Selecting text does not automatically put it into the clipboard.
After it's deselected, then it cannot be "stuffed" elsewhere from the
clipboard.
</ul>

<h3><a href="$TYCHO/kernel/EditSearch.itcl">EditSearch</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Hitting the "change" or "change and find" buttons with "change all"
    enabled should force a search to occur.  Currently, it just changes
    the selection, if there is one.
</ul>

<h3><a href="$TYCHO/kernel/EditSpell.itcl">EditSpell</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Spelling checker should ignore single letter words.
</ul>

<h3><a href="$TYCHO/kernel/File.itcl">File</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Crash recovery code only works with Ptolemy binaries.
</ul>

<h3><a href="$TYCHO/kernel/FileBrowser.itcl">FileBrowser</a></h3>
<ul>

<li>Name completion does not work through directories, you can only
complete names of files in the current directory, not names in the sub
directories.


</ul>

<h3><a href="$TYCHO/kernel/Glimpse.itcl">Glimpse</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Glimpse should not freeze Tycho while running. Searching
through say the Ptolemy tree can take a very long time.
<li>Glimpse.itcl should probably not be in the kernel.
<li>If $TYCHO/.glimpse_exclude is not present, then we should
as the user if we want to create it.
</ul>

<h3><a href="$TYCHO/kernel/HTML.itcl">HTML</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>If I create a new Java template and generate the
doc the indenting is all wrong, because the file contains
HTML like:
<pre>
  &lt;dl&gt;
    &lt;dt&gt; &lt;b&gt;Parameters:&lt;/b&gt;
    &lt;dd&gt; parameter-name - description
    &lt;dd&gt; parameter-name - description
    &lt;dt&gt; &lt;b&gt;Returns:&lt;/b&gt;
    &lt;dd&gt; description
  &lt;/dl&gt;
</pre>
Tycho's HTML viewer doesn't deal with the double &lt;dd&gt;
(Netscape does, BTW).
<li>The HTML parser is quite slow.
<li>In "img" directives, align="right" causes an error.
<li>In "img" directives dollar signs are not properly handled.
The HTML code:
<PRE>
&lt;img src="$PTOLEMY/tycho/typt/kernel/img/ptolemyWelcome.gif" &gt;
</PRE>
fails:
<img src="$PTOLEMY/tycho/typt/kernel/img/ptolemyWelcome.gif" >

<li>A &lt;p&gt; after an image is ignored.
<li>If you have the source code for an HTML file open, and you try to open
    with HTML file with the "Back" command, you get an error message that
    is basically wrong, since there is no problem.
<li>    If I have two HTML viewers open and if in one of them I click on
    a link that references the file open in the other, the other
    one is brought to the font and the one I am looking at doesn't
    change. This isn't what some people would expect.
<li>    HTTP is not supported, so hyperlinks can only be to local files.
<li>    There should be a menu entry to hide the toolbar and location.
<li>    Not all toolbar commands are available from menus.
<li>    There are no key bindings for toolbar commands.
<li>    The print command prints only a crude facsimile of the document.
<li>	Need to support forms (most of the infrastructure is there already).
<li> 	Need to support mailto, gif files, etc.
<li> 	The following two line html file causes an error:
<PRE>
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/tcl&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/tcl&gt;
</PRE>
<li> 	The following one line html file causes an error because
the backslash precedes the <CODE>&lt;/CODE&gt;</CODE>.

<PRE>
&lt;CODE&gt;c:&#92;Program Files&#92;tycho0.1.1&#92;&lt;/CODE&gt;
</PRE>
The short term workaround is to add a space:
<PRE>
&lt;CODE&gt;c:&#92;Program Files&#92;tycho0.1.1&#92; &lt;/CODE&gt;
</PRE>

<li> If you Open Source and then do a Save As in the source file
window to save the source as a different file, then executing
Open Source in the HTML viewer again raises the new file
instead of re-opening the source file.

<li> If an HTML viewer and editor are open on the same file,
then there is no window menu entry for the editor. This is
a mis-feature (hjr): when editing a bunch of HTML source
files, I should be able to get to the sources without having
to bring the viewer to the front and then bring the editor
up from behind it.

<li>It would be nice if there was a simple way of opening
an HTML editor on a file. Perhaps we need a way of registering
_multiple_ editors for a file extension and have a popup
menu in the file browser that selects the type of editor.


<li> The status line usually displays where the hyperlink under the
mouse goes.  If you have more than one hyperlink in a menu arranged
vertically, then the status line is not updated as you move the mouse
vertically.  See the menu at the top of <A
HREF="tynt.html"><CODE>tynt.html</CODE></A>.

</ul>

<h3><a href="$TYCHO/kernel/Query.itcl">Query</a></h3>
<ul>

<li> Control-v in the search window inserts garbage into the search
field.

</ul>

<h3><a href="$TYCHO/kernel/RevControlRCS.itcl">RevControlRCS</a></h3>
<ul>

<li> Unfortunately, if RCS does not necessarily put the version
control files in the RCS subdirectory.  If the RCS subdirectory does
not exist, then the directory is not created and the version control
file is put in the current directory.

</ul>

<h3><a href="$TYCHO/kernel/RevControlSCCS.itcl">RevControlSCCS</a></h3>
<ul>

<li> Revision control appears to use the file permissions to test
whether a file is checked out. To see, check out a file, change
permissions to 444, and open the rev control window in Tycho.
It should check for the lock file.

</ul>


<h3><a href="$TYCHO/kernel/TclShell.itcl">TclShell</a></h3>
<ul>
<li> When a TclShell is displaying stdout on its last line, typed
commands are not always interpreted correctly.
<li> Meta-&lt; is not interpreted correctly: it puts the insertion
cursor at the top of the shell.  It should only put the view up there.
It needs to run adjustInsertionCursor.
</ul>

<h3><a href="$TYCHO/kernel/WelcomeWindow.itcl">WelcomeWindow</a></h3>
<ul>
<li> If your ptolemy binary has a long name,
	then the welcome window is cropped at the bottom, and there
	is no scrollbar.  We don't generally want a scrollbar here,
        and either the space bar or C-x v will scroll down (or the
 	page down or down arrow buttons), so it's not clear this is a
	bug.
</ul>

<h1><a name="bugs in text editors">Bugs in text editors</a></h1>

<h3><a href="$TYCHO/editors/textedit/EditHTML.itcl">EditHTML</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Hyperlinks to other files are not composed with the directory of
of the current file.  Instead, it uses the pwd.
<li>The Check Hyperlinks command flags every http reference as an error.
Since it can't do HTTP yet, it should ignore these.
</ul>

<h3><a href="$TYCHO/editors/textedit/EditProgram.itcl">EditProgram</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Indent region should be undoable.
<li>Spelling checker should ignore HTML directives in comments.
<li>When generating docs, if the documentation
directory is not writable, the user should be asked if they want to
create their own doc directory.
</ul>

<h3><a href="$TYCHO/editors/textedit/EditTcl.itcl">EditTcl</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Indenting fails to ignore backslash on the end of a comment line.
<li>Indenting confused by a single line with "if {" and nothing more.
</ul>

<h3><a href="$TYCHO/editors/textedit/EditC.itcl">EditC</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Indenting needs a lot of work.
</ul>

<h1><a name="bugs in visual editors">Bugs in visual editors</a></h1>
There are lots of bugs to be fixed in the visual editors, here are 
some of the biggies.
<h3><a href="$TYCHO/editors/visedit/Graphics.itcl">Graphics</a></h3>
<ul>
<li> Cut and past does not work in the Graphics widget.
<li> Moved titles new position is not saved.
<li> Moving or adding titles does not mark the buffer modified.
<li> Most bindings in the File menu do not work.
</ul>

<h3><a href="$TYCHO/editors/visedit/TclProfile.itcl">TclProfile</a></h3>
<ul>
<li> The TclProfile probably won't work under Windows unless TclX is
installed by hand.  The <CODE>lib/profile</CODE> directory probably
won't help much.

<li> Sometimes 4 colons instead of 2 colons are printed.
</ul>

<h1><a name="bugs in gendoc">Bugs in the documentation generator</a></h1>

<ul>
<li>The gendoc command leaves a huge number of ::tycho::DocClass objects
    around after completing.  Do "info objects" after running gendoc
    to see them.

</ul>

<H2><A NAME="bugs, Ptolemy/Tycho docs">Ptolemy/Tycho bugs </A></H2>
<OL>

<LI> If you start <CODE>tycho -ptiny</CODE> and put it in the
background, the Matlab interface might not start up on SystemV
operating systems such as Solaris and HPUX.  This workaround is to
start <CODE>tycho -ptiny &gt;/dev/null &amp;</CODE>

</OL>
