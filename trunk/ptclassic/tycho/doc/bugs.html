<h1><a name="bugs in the kernel">Bugs in the kernel</a></h1>

<h3><a href="../kernel/MenuBar.itcl">MenuBar</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>If you add a menu with a name that already exists, and the
existing menu is before an entry that has no -label option
(such as a separator), then the add will fail with an error.
The reason is that the menubar uses the menu label as the
only way of accessing menu entries, and separators have no
label! The design is flawed, but it's probably not worth fixing
this until we find out what support Tk 8.0 has for menubars,
and using that.

</ul>

<h3><a href="../kernel/File.itcl">File</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>When you open a non-existent HTML file, you probably want
the HTML editor, not the HTML viewer. But that's what you get.
</ul>

<h3><a href="../kernel/Displayer.itcl">Displayer</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The menu buttons created in MenuSupport and MenuBar may need to be
    made global (with an uplevel #0).
</ul>

<h3><a href="../kernel/Edit.itcl">Edit</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Fill region is much too slow.
<li>The undo in the text widgets is only one level deep.
<li>Need a "find-again" binding, and perhaps emacs-style incremental search.
<li>Selecting text does not automatically put it into the clipboard.
After it's deselected, then it cannot be "stuffed" elsewhere from the
clipboard.
</ul>

<h3><a href="../kernel/File.itcl">File</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Crash recovery code only works with Ptolemy binaries.
</ul>

<h3><a href="../kernel/Glimpse.itcl">Glimpse</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Glimpse should not freeze Tycho while running. Searching
through say the Ptolemy tree can take a very long time.
<li><CODE>Glimpse.itcl</CODE> should probably not be in the kernel.
<li>If <CODE>$TYCHO/.glimpse_exclude</Code> is not present, then we should
ask the user if we want to create it.
</ul>

<h3><a href="../kernel/HTML.itcl">HTML</a></h3>
<H4>HTML Rendering bugs</H4>

<ul>

<li>In "img" directives, align="right" and size
    directives (width and height) are ignored.
<li>A construct like
 <CODE>&lt;center&gt; &lt;img ... &gt; &lt;/center&gt;</CODE>
    results in an in-line image rather than a centered image.
<li>A <CODE>&lt;p&gt;</CODE> after an image is ignored.
<li> 	The following two line HTML file causes an error:
<PRE>
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/tcl&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/tcl&gt;
</PRE>
<li> 	The following one line html file causes an error because
    the backslash precedes the <CODE>&lt;/CODE&gt;</CODE>.

<PRE>
&lt;CODE&gt;c:&#92;Program Files&#92;tycho0.1.1&#92;&lt;/CODE&gt;
</PRE>
The short term workaround is to add a space:
<PRE>
&lt;CODE&gt;c:&#92;Program Files&#92;tycho0.1.1&#92; &lt;/CODE&gt;
</PRE>

</ul>


<H4>HTML Interface Bugs and Requests for Enhancement</H4>

<ul>
<li>    If I have two HTML viewers open and if in one of them I click on
    a link that references the file open in the other, the other
    one is brought to the front and the one I am looking at doesn't
    change. This isn't what some people would expect.
<li>    HTTP is not supported, so hyperlinks can only be to local files.
<li>    There should be a menu entry to hide the toolbar and location.
<li>    Not all toolbar commands are available from menus.
<li>    There are no key bindings for toolbar commands.
<li>    The print command prints only a crude facsimile of the document.
<li>	Need to support forms (most of the infrastructure is there already).
<li> 	Need to support mailto, gif files, etc.

<li> If you <CODE>Open Source</CODE> and then do a <CODE>Save As</CODE>
in the source file window to save the source as a different
file, then executing <CODE>Open Source</CODE> in the HTML viewer again
raises the new file instead of re-opening the source file.

<li> If an HTML viewer and editor are open on the same file,
then there is no window menu entry for the editor. This is
a mis-feature (hjr): when editing a bunch of HTML source
files, I should be able to get to the sources without having
to bring the viewer to the front and then bring the editor
up from behind it.

<li>It would be nice if there was a simple way of opening
an HTML editor on a file. Perhaps we need a way of registering
_multiple_ editors for a file extension and have a pop-up
menu in the file browser that selects the type of editor.

</ul>

<h3><a href="../kernel/Query.itcl">Query</a></h3>
<ul>

<li> <CODE>Control-v</CODE> in the search window inserts garbage into
the search field.

</ul>

<h3><a href="../kernel/RevControlRCS.itcl">RevControlRCS</a></h3>
<ul>

<li> Unfortunately, if RCS does not necessarily put the version
control files in the RCS subdirectory.  If the RCS subdirectory does
not exist, then the directory is not created and the version control
file is put in the current directory.

</ul>

<h3><a href="../kernel/RevControlSCCS.itcl">RevControlSCCS</a></h3>
<ul>

<li> Revision control appears to use the file permissions to test
whether a file is checked out. To see, check out a file, change
permissions to 444, and open the rev control window in Tycho.
It should check for the lock file.

</ul>


<h3><a href="../kernel/TclShell.itcl">TclShell</a></h3>
<ul>
<li> When a TclShell is displaying stdout on its last line, typed
commands are not always interpreted correctly.
<li> <CODE>Meta-&lt;</CODE> is not interpreted correctly: it puts the insertion
cursor at the top of the shell.  It should only put the view up there.
It needs to run <CODE>adjustInsertionCursor</CODE>.
</ul>

<h3><a href="../kernel/WelcomeWindow.itcl">WelcomeWindow</a></h3>
<ul>
<li> If your ptolemy binary has a long name,
	then the welcome window is cropped at the bottom, and there
	is no scrollbar.  We don't generally want a scrollbar here,
        and either the space bar or <CODE>C-x v</CODE> will scroll down (or the
 	page down or down arrow buttons), so it's not clear this is a
	bug.
</ul>

<h1><a name="bugs in text editors">Bugs in text editors</a></h1>

<h3><a href="../editors/textedit/EditHTML.itcl">EditHTML</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The Check Hyperlinks command flags every http reference as an error.
Since it can't do HTTP yet, it should ignore these.
</ul>

<h3><a href="../editors/textedit/EditProgram.itcl">EditProgram</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Indent region should be undoable.
<li>Spelling checker should ignore HTML directives in comments.
<li>When generating docs, if the documentation
directory is not writable, the user should be asked if they want to
create their own doc directory.
</ul>

<h3><a href="../editors/textedit/EditTcl.itcl">EditTcl</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Indenting fails to ignore backslash on the end of a comment line.
<li>Indenting confused by a single line with "if {" and nothing more.
</ul>

<h3><a href="../editors/textedit/EditC.itcl">EditC</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Indenting needs a lot of work.
</ul>

<h1><a name="bugs in visual editors">Bugs in visual editors</a></h1>
There are lots of bugs to be fixed in the visual editors, here are 
some of the biggies.
<h3><a href="../editors/visedit/Graphics.itcl">Graphics</a></h3>
<ul>
<li> Cut and paste does not work in the Graphics widget.
<li> Moved titles new position is not saved.
<li> Moving or adding titles does not mark the buffer modified.
<li> Most bindings in the File menu do not work.
</ul>

<h3><a href="../editors/visedit/TclProfile.itcl">TclProfile</a></h3>
<ul>
<li> The TclProfile probably won't work under Windows unless TclX is
installed by hand.  The <CODE>lib/profile</CODE> directory probably
won't help much.

<li> Sometimes 4 colons instead of 2 colons are printed.
</ul>

<h1><a name="bugs in gendoc">Bugs in the documentation generator</a></h1>

<ul>
<li>The <CODE>gendoc</CODE> command leaves a huge number of
    <CODE>::tycho::DocClass</CODE>
    objects around after completing.  Do <CODE>info objects</CODE> after
    running <CODE>gendoc</CODE> to see them.

</ul>

<H2><a name="bugs in java">Bugs in the Tycho/Java environment</a></H2>
<OL>
<LI> The prebuilt Itcl binaries will only work with TclJava
if they are installed in <CODE>/users/ptolemy/tcltk</CODE>.


<LI> The Tycho/Java interface is built on top of the TclJava
interface.  The Tycho/Java interface uses the Reflect class, which is
only available in JDK1.1 and later.  As of 5/22/97, JDK1.1.1 was only
available from
<A HREF="http://www.javasoft.com"><CODE>www.javasoft.com</CODE></A>
for Solaris2.x on Sparc and x86 and for Windows96/NT.  If you are
running under a platform such as HPUX10.20, which only has JDK1.0.2,
you probably won't be able to get the Tycho/Java interface to compile.
</OL>

<H2><A NAME="bugs in Ptolemy/Tycho">Ptolemy/Tycho bugs </A></H2>
<OL>
<LI> If you start <CODE>tycho -ptiny</CODE> and put it in the
background, the Matlab interface might not start up on SystemV
operating systems such as Solaris and HPUX.  This workaround is to
start <CODE>tycho -ptiny &gt;/dev/null &amp;</CODE>

</OL>
