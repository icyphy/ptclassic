Below is a sample header that could be grabbed and put into a new
file.  (Of course, you would need to adjust the description,
<CODE>@Author</CODE> and possibly the copyright dates.

<H3><A NAME="doc tags">Doc Tags</A></H3>

The header contains <I>doc tags</I> to identify different parts of the
header.  Doc tags are more fully described in the <A
HREF="../../lib/tydoc/doc/introduction.html"><CODE>tydoc</CODE></A>
documentation, but briefly, a doc tag is a keyword, such as
<CODE>@Author</CODE> that is at the start of a comment.  Doc tags are
case-insensitive, and my be pluralized.  The trailing colon
"<CODE>:</CODE>" is optional, and it is not part of the doc tag.  If
the trailing colon is present, the tydoc removes it from the comment.

<H3><A NAME="the order of elements">The order of elements</A></H3>
	
The file header consists of the following elements, separated by blank
lines.  Note that the order of tags should strictly followed for
consistency between files.
	
<OL>
	<LI> A one line description of what the file does

	<LI>  <CODE>@Author:</CODE> -
	The primary Author(s) of the file.  If you have more than one
	author, use <CODE>@Authors</CODE>.

	<LI>  <CODE>@Contributor:</CODE> -
	(Optional) People who have contributed to this file.  If there
	are more than one contributor, you can pluralize this.	
	
	<LI> <CODE>@Version:</CODE> -
	The Version control information for this file.  The version
	control system can automatically update special characters at
	file check in time, so that the file can contain the date and
	version number.  Currently, we are using SCCS at UC Berkeley.
	If you use the string
	<PRE>
	# @Version: &#37;W&#37; &#37;G&#37;
	</PRE>
	Then SCCS will convert this to the file name, version number
	and date:
	<PRE>
	# @Version: @(#)Tycho.tcl	1.37	6/14/96
	</PRE>
	Note that there is a space between &#37;W&#37; &#37;G&#37;, not a tab.

	<LI>  <CODE>@Copyright</CODE> -
	The Copyright for this file.  Usually <CODE>@Copyright</CODE>
	is not followed by a colon.  The issue of copyrights is fairly
	tricky, if you are an employee of UC Berkeley, you should
	include the copyright as it is printed above.  Note that the
	special symbol is expanded at our site at UC Berkeley to be
	the current year.
</OL>
	
<H3><A NAME="copyrights">Copyrights</A></H3>

If you create a new file, then your copyright should have just
<CODE>&#37;Q&#37;</CODE> instead of 1991-<CODE>&#37;Q&#37;</CODE>.  If
your file is a rewrite of a previously copyrighted file from UC
Berkeley, then you should include the date from that file.  

 <P>If your
file is based on a file that has non-UC Berkeley copyrights, then you
should be sure to include the copyrights.
