<h2><a name="code rating overview">Overview and purpose</a></h2>
The code rating system is designed to improve:
<ul>
<li> code quality
<li> code stability
</ul>

 <P>Each class is advanced through four levels of confidence by a
light-weight review and testing process. There are two ratings for
each class: that <I>proposed</I> by its author or maintainer, and that
<I>accepted</I> by its tester and reviewers. This approach tries to
maintain the accepted principles of code review and testing by people
other than the author, while keeping overhead manageable for a
research group.

 <P>The basic idea is that the author proposes that a class advance a
level. The tester/reviewer is then responsible for examining the class
(with the help of other reviewers, if necessary), writing test code
for it, and either accepting or rejecting the proposed advancement.
The tester/reviewer needs to provide specific and concrete reasons for
rejection; the author is obliged to make needed modifications and
re-submit the code.

<P>The four levels of confidence are <I>red</I>, <I>yellow</I>,
<I>green</I>, and <I>blue</I>. Each level has a well-defined meaning,
which both the author and tester/reviewer are expected to satisfy
before proposing or accepting advancement to that level.  The level of
a class or file is indicated in the file header comment with the tags
<code>@ProposedRating</code> and <code>@AcceptedRating</code>.  A file that has
neither of these tags is <I>unrated</I>.

 <P> There is room within the process for design reviews and code
reviews, although the degree to which these are applied is up to the
author and maintainer, and may vary according to the project or
sub-project in which the class lies.


<h2><a name="code rating levels">Code rating levels</a></h2>
The four ratings are as follows:

<dl>

<dt><code>Red</code>

<dd> This is the starting point for all code. Red code is in flux, and
cn be expected to changed without warning. Code that calls red code
does not need to be modified by the author if changes in the red code
break the calling code.  Red code should never be released.

 <P><dl>
 <dt><I>Proposing advancement</I>

<dd> Code is made red simply by adding the <code>@ProposedRating</code> tag
followed by "red" to the file header comment. The author should do
this, and should also add the <code>@AcceptedRating</code> tag (solely for
the purpose of making it easier to search with grep). At the same time,
the author should check the file into the shared development
tree, add it to the appropriate makefile, and <I>check that the build
does not fail</i>.

 <P><dt><I>Accepting advancement</I>

<dd> 
"Advancement" to red is automatic. If the author does not add the
<code>@AcceptedRating</code> tag, the code rating tools will assume
that it is red.
 
 <P><dt><I>Acceptable changes</I>

<dd> 
Any changes at all can be made to red code, with one significant
condition: red code that is checked into the shared development
tree must not cause the build to fail.

</dl>


 <P><dt><code>Yellow</code>

<dd>The interface and overall design of yellow code is considered to
be acceptable.  Clients can code to this interface with the
expectation that further changes will be limited to revisions, not
major changes.  Clients cannot expect that yellow code has any
functionality behind the interface.  Yellow code should generally not
be released.

 <P><dl>
 <dt><I>Proposing advancement</I>

<dd> The author proposes advancement to yellow when he/she is
satisfied with the design of the class, and how it collaborates with
other classes. Before proposing advancement to yellow, the author is
responsible for making sure that the class is adequately documented
and that automatically generated documentation produced by tydoc or
javadoc is correct and reasonably complete. The author is also
responsible for ensuring that appropriate design documentation -- UML
diagram, for example -- is complete and readable.

 <P><dt><I>Accepting advancement</I>

<dd> The tester/reviewer accepts advancement to yellow when he/she is
satisfied that the design of the class is satisfactory. What
"satisfactory" means is a matter of judgment, based on the project the
work is taking place in and the stated purpose of the class.  The
tester/reviewer should evaluate the design and interface of the class
solely on the basis of the design documentation and the documentation
generated by tydoc or javadoc -- in other words, without reading the
source code. Note that, in the case of classes which are designed to
be subclassed, this includes the (protected) interface provided to
subclasses.

 <P> If appropriate, the tester/reviewer is entitled to request UML
diagrams as an aid to understanding the purpose and function of the
class, and is entitled to organize a design review at this time. The
tester/reviewer is also entitled to require changes to the interface
in anticipation of testing needs.

 <P><dt><I>Acceptable changes</I>

<dd> Yellow code can have minor interface changes before advancing to
green.  If wholesale changes are required, the author should request
that the class be taken back to red. If the author changes the
interface to yellow code, then he is responsible for:
 <P>
<OL>
<LI> Making sure that the calling code compiles.
<LI> Notifying the author of calling code about the change.
<LI> Updating the design documents and tydoc or javadoc output.
</OL>

 <P>
The author is not responsible for making sure that the calling code
works or passes its test suites, as yellow code does not provide any
assurance of functionality. (But see <A
HREF="#retrospective">Retrospective application of code rating</A>.)

</dl>

 <P><dt><code>Green</code>

<dd>
The interface to green code has been finalized, and the implementation
is considered acceptable for development purposes.  Clients can code
to green code in the expectation that the interface will not change in
such a way as to break compilation, nor will the implementation change
enough to break the caller's test suite.  Green code is releasable.


 <P><dl>
<dt><I>Proposing advancement</I>

<dd>The author proposes advancement to green when he/she is satisfied
that the interface to the class is final, except for relatively minor
enhancements and additions, and that the implementation of the class
is satisfactory. This could be considered "beta" level code. Before
proposing advancement to green, the author is responsible for
providing a test suite that exercises and demonstrates the main
functionality of the class.

 <P><dt><I>Accepting advancement</I>

<dd>The tester/reviewer accepts advancement to green if he/she is
satisfied with the implementation of the class. The tester/reviewer
shall determine this by a) writing a test suite, and b) reviewing the
code. The test suite should have at least 50% code coverage.  If
appropriate, the tester/reviewer is entitled to organize a code review
at this time. The author is required to write example test code if
requested by the tester/reviewer.

 <P><dt><I>Acceptable changes</I>

<dd>The interface to green code can only have incremental interface
changes (that is, new methods). Small changes, such as an additional
argument or a change in an argument type, are acceptable but should
first be cleared with authors of client classes. In any case, the
author is required to fix any test suites or clients that break as a
result.

 <P>Implementation changes to green code are allowed, provided that
they do not require clients to change the order of calls (which is, in
effect, changing the interface.) The author must verify that changes
do not break any test suites, and is required to fix the clients
and/or test suites if they do. If a change will require substantial
fixes, then the class should probably be taken back to yellow.

</dl>

 <P><dt><code>Blue</code>

<dd>The implementation of the class has been fully and completely
tested, and accepted as meeting all requirements.  All documentation,
including external documentation if appropriate, is complete. Blue
code is releasable.

 <P><dl>

<dt><I>Proposing advancement</I>

<dd> The author proposes advancement to blue when he/she is satisfied
that the class is finished, polished, flexible, and robust. This
applies to the documentation as well as the code.  This is, in other
words, quality releasable code. In general, code should not be
advanced to blue until it has been in use by other classes for some
time.

 <P><dt><I>Accepting advancement</I>

<dd>The tester/reviewer accepts advancement to blue when he/she is
satisfied that the class is finished, polished, flexible, and robust.
The tester/reviewer determines this by completing the test suite to
get 100% coverage, or as close as is reasonable given the way that the
class operates with other classes, and possibly also by writing a test
suite that tests this class working in collaboration with other
classes.

 <P><dt><I>Acceptable changes</I>

<dd>Blue code can have bug fixes, but changes to the external
interface, inherited interface, or observable behavior, make the class
a candidate for reversion to green or yellow status.

</dl>

</dl>


<h2><a name="code rating rules">Code rating rules</a></h2>
<p>

 <P>The following rules apply to rating levels. These are not enforced
in any way, but should be understood anyway:

<ul> <li> The rating given by a tester is no greater than that
given by the author. (This one is obvious.)

 <P>
<li> The rating of a class is no greater than the corresponding rating
of its superclass. In Java, the same applies to any implemented
interfaces. For the purposes of rating, external libraries
are assumed to be blue. (This says that a subclass is no better
than the classes it inherits from.)

 <P>
<li>The rating of a calling class can be red or yellow regardless of
the corresponding rating of the callee. The rating of a calling class
can be green or blue only if the corresponding rating of the
callee is equal or greater. (This says that the implementation
of a class can be no better than the interface and implementation
of a class that it depends upon.)

</ul>

<h2><a name="code rating tools">Tool support</a></h2>
Tycho's revision control mechanism and documentation generation
system supports the code rating system. The following doctags
can be added to the comment at the head of a file:

<dl> <dt><code>@ProposedRating <I>rating</I> { <I>author</I>
&lt;<I>emailaddress</I>&gt;) }</code>

<dd>The rating proposed by the author, where rating is Red,
Yellow, Green, or Blue. The author field is optional: if not
supplied, Tycho will attempt to get it from the <code>@Author</code> doctag.

 <P>
<dt><code>@AcceptedRating <I>rating</I> { <I>tester</I>
&lt;<I>emailaddress</I>&gt;) }</code>


<dd>The rating accepted by the tester/reviewer, where rating is Red,
Yellow, Green, or Blue. The tester field is optional, but the
rating system will not function properly without it. If it is missing,
Tycho will probably just use the author.

</dl>

 <P>Tycho takes the following actions:

<ul>

<li>When a file is checked-in, it compares the proposed rating with the
proposed rating in the previous version of the file. (For this to work
properly, Tycho will also need to annotate the file with the last
version it checked -- not everyone uses Tycho all the time.)  If it is
different, Tycho sends email to the tester notifying him of the
change.

 <P><li>Tycho does the same for the accepted rating. If this is
different from the previously checked version, Tycho sends email
to the author notifying him of the acceptance.

 <P><li>Tycho does not automatically add rating doctags if there are none.
The UI does, however, have a button that allows the user to have Tycho
add them.

</ul>

Other tools may be built in future, such as graphical overviews
of code ratings to indicate where work needs to be done prior
to a release.

 <P>Tycho's revision control system needs some modifications which
should be considered by whoever implements the above:

<ul>

<li>Currently, the revision control functions are implemented within
the user interface widgets. This approach will prevent source code
management tools that run off-line from ever working with Tycho's
revision control and code rating support. These classes need to be
modified to use the Strategy pattern: A single user-interface widget,
and a small hierarchy of non-graphical objects that provide the
revision-control and code rating functionality.

 <P><li>There is no way to check in multiple files. This discourages use
of Tycho's revision control mechanism in situations in which a number
of related files have been modified.

 <P><li>The check-in comment window is modal. It needs to be made
non-modal, in order that the code can be viewed while writing the
check-in comment (like emacs).

</ul>


<h2><a name="retrospective">Retrospective application of code rating</a></h2>

The rating guidelines need to be modified somewhat if the
ratings are added after the code is already being developed.
Typical problems may include the following:

<ul>

<li>The code is only at red or yellow, yet there are already test
suites. which have a tendency to break whenever the code is modified.

 <P>
<li>The code starts at red, but nobody wants to take the trouble to go
through yellow before getting to green, because the implementation
is already considered sound -- so why go to the trouble of messing about
with yellow?

</ul>

Basically, the right approach in situations like this is to use
judgment. The author and tester/review should, when entering the
rating system, recognize that the code is an exception to the usual
application of the code rating system, and modify the guidelines
appropriately. Here are some particular guidelines for
code that has been recognized as exceptional:

<ul>
<li> If test suites exist already, then the author should
either:

 <P>
<ol>
<li>Make sure that all tests still pass after each modification, or

 <P>
<li>Remove the tests from the test suite (with the tester/reviewer's
approval) and fix them when proposing advancement to green.

</ol>

 <P><li> If code is already considered robust and generally 
"done," then it is up to the author and reviewer to decide
if they want to skip yellow. Before doing this, they should first
consider:

 <P><ol>

<li>Whether it would be better to just leave the code unrated.
Unrated code that is fully developed is better left unrated if it is
not going to be used in conjunction with new code that is being
developed under the rating system. If, however, it is being subclassed
or heavily used by new, rated, code, then it should also be brought
into the rating system.

 <P><li>Whether the code really is as good as expected for green level --
having been in use for some time does not automatically make this
so. It is important to remember that the purpose of code rating is to
improve quality. If no-one has time or energy to advance this kind of
code through each level, then it may be better to just leave it
unrated, red, or yellow.

</ol>

</ul>


<h2><a name="code rating FAQ">Infrequently-asked questions</a></h2>

<dl>

 <P><dt><I>Isn't this too rigid and complicated for a research
group?</I>

<dd>No: your code doesn't have to pass any reviews or tests for it to
be in the tree, although it may not be considered eligible for
release. The degree to which the review and testing process is carried
out is determined by the perceived needs of users of your code. In any
case, you should really view the process as an opportunity to improve
the quality of both your own code and that of our research group as a
whole

 <P><dt><I>Nobody really writes an interface without writing
code at the same time. Doesn't this make yellow redundant?</I>

<dd>No. Firstly, the premise is debatable, especially given the
maturity of modeling languages such as OMT and UML. Secondly, it
doesn't matter: if an author chooses to completely write the
implementation of a class before proposing that it be made yellow,
that's fine. If this approach makes him or her more confident that the
class will make it to green without any substantial changes, even
better -- and the author will have less work to do to get the code to
green. However, acceptance at level yellow only implies acceptance of
the interface, and all the same guidelines about usage still apply.

 <P><dt><I>Haven't you neglected the incremental improvements that all
code goes through?</I>

<dd>No... and yes. There are simple guidelines for what kinds of
changes can be made to code at each level -- in particular, red and
yellow are flexible with regard to allowing changes. On the other
hand, changes to code are often caused by a weakness in the original
interface or implementation, which is why the process provides
specific points at which design and code reviews can be done if
considered appropriate. If needed improvements cannot be done without
gross violation of the guidelines for that level, then the author or
modifier can propose that the code be taken back one, two, or even
three levels.

 <P><dt><I>The requirements to get to blue are pretty severe. Why?</i>

<dd>Because blue is there as a rating for code that has been very
thoroughly thought-through, documented, and tested. Many classes may
never get to blue, and that's fine.

 <P><dt><I>What about the user-interface aspect of a class?</i>

<dd>Good question! The code rating system does not explicitly deal
with the user interface appearance or behavior of a class. We're
going to just have to use our judgment to start with, and when we
have more experience with the review process we can decide whether 
and how to incorporate user interface aspects into the ratings.
