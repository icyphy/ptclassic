<h3><a name="scoping problems">Scoping problems</a></h3>
<p>
One of the trickiest parts about using Itcl is to properly
manage namespaces and scope.
A key problem that arises repeatedly is how to construct
a command that is bound to an event (like a key press),
bound to a button, executed in the background using "after,"
or executed in some scope different from where the command
is defined.  In general, the problem is that a command
has a namespace context.  There are two
ways in Itcl that this namespace context can be represented:
<pre>
    ::namespace::commandname
    {@scope ::namespace commandname}
</pre>
Either of these can be executed as a command.
(One of the unfortunately features of Itcl is that there are
several ways to accomplish just about everything related to
namespaces and scope, and the subtle differences between them
are not always clear.)
<p>
Within an Itcl object, the variable "this"
has the first of these two forms, as a fully qualified command name.
The "info which" command can be used to obtain the first form for any
command ("this" only works for an object).
The "code" or the "scope" commands can be used to obtain the second form.
<p>
In Itcl, all commands that are executed as a consequence of a keyboard
or window event are executed at the global scope (in namespace "::").
Also, commands executed in the background using "after" are executed
at the global scope.  To verify this, we can use the
<a name="info context command">"info context" command</a>,
which returns a null string at the global scope.
For example:
<tcl><pre>
namespace foo {
   ::tycho::inform "Inside context: [info context]"
   after idle {
      ::tycho::inform "after context: [info context]"
   }
}
</pre></tcl>
Above, we find that the context inside the namespace is
reported as "::foo", but in the "after" command, it is reported
as an empty string, meaning the global context.
Button commands work similarly:
<tcl><pre>
namespace foo {
   catch {destroy .x}
   toplevel .x
   button .x.b -text pushme -command {
      ::tycho::inform "button context: [info context]"
      destroy .x
   }
   pack .x.b
}
</pre></tcl> 
Again, the button command executes at the global scope.
Thus, the challenge when building Itcl objects within namespaces
is to be sure that commands that will execute at global scope can
in fact execute at global scope.
There are a number of ways to do this.
<p>
<h3><a name="bind command">Using the "bind" command</a></h3>
<p>
Bindings to key or mouse events, like the button presses above,
execute at the global scope.  Itcl has provided two particularly
useful additions to the special symbols that the bind command
understands:
<dl>
<dt><CODE>%q</CODE>
<dd>Returns the fully-qualified command name of object receiving
the event.
<dt><CODE>%Q</CODE>
<dd>Returns the fully-qualified command name of megawidget
receiving the event
</dl>
<p>
These can be used as in the following example:
<tcl><pre>
namespace foo {
   catch {delete class bar}
   class bar {
      inherit ::itk::Toplevel
      constructor {args} {
         itk_component add f {
            canvas $itk_interior.f
         } {}
         pack $itk_component(f)
         bind $itk_component(hull) &lt;a&gt; &#92
            {::tycho::inform "expansion of %%q: %q"}
         bind $itk_component(hull) &lt;b&gt; &#92
            {delete object %q}
      }
   }
   bar .y   
}
</pre></tcl>
Here, we define a class "bar" inside namespace "foo" derived from
an Itk top-level window class.  In the constructor, we pack
into the window a canvas widget.
We bind the key "a" to simply report the expansion for "%q",
which will be "::foo::.y".
The key "b" uses this expansion to delete the object.
Notice that the window specified for the bindings is
"$itk_component(hull)", which will be the top-level window.
<p>
The "%Q" directive is similar, except that the full
expanded name of an Itk megawidget will
be reported.
<p>
The <a name="winfo command command">"winfo command windowname"</a>
command returns the fully-qualified command name of
an object given a Tk top-level window name.
For example, if the canvas window from the above example is still
present, try:
<tcl><pre>
    ::tycho::inform [winfo command .y]
</pre></tcl>
Notice that this can execute in the global scope.
The window name ".y" is visible to Tk in any scope because Tk
has only a flat name space.  The Itk object ".y", however, is
not visible in the global scope.
<p>
The <a name="winfo megawidget windowname">"winfo megawidget windowname"</a>
command is similar, except that it returns the name of an Itk megawidget
rather than a top-level window object.
The specified window name can be any window inside the megawidget.
<p>
<h3><a name="this variable">Using the variable "this"</a></h3>
<p>
The variable "this" inside a class context has as its value
the fully qualified command name associated with the object
(yes, it could have been used instead of %q in the above example).
Consider the following:
<tcl><pre>
namespace foo {
   catch {delete class bar}
   class bar {
      constructor {args} {
         ::tycho::inform "Constructing object: $this"
         ::tycho::inform "Current context: [info context]"
         after idle "$this x"
      }
      method x {} {::tycho::inform {works}}
   }
   bar y
}
</pre></tcl>
The value of the variable "this" is reported as "::foo::y", which is the
fully qualified command name associated with the object "y".
The context inside the constructor is "::foo::bar", a namespace
associated with the class.
The command "$this x" or "::foo::y x" can be executed at the global
scope, so the "after" directive works.
Notice that it would not have worked to say:
<pre>
         after idle {$this x}
</pre>
because the "$this" will not be evaluated until the "after" command
triggers, and this will happen at the global scope where no variable
"this" is defined.
<p>
If in a binding or delayed invocation using "after" you wish to access
methods in a widget contained in the calling widget, use
syntax like that in the following example:
<pre>
   after idle "$this component name method arg1 arg2 ... "
</pre>
Here, "name" is the name of the Itk component, "method" is the name
of its method, and the argument list is the arguments to pass to the method.
<p>
<h3><a name="info which command">Using "info which command"</a></h3>
<p>
The "info which" command
takes one argument, which is the name of a command in the
current scope, and returns a fully qualified command with namespace
information. Thus, for example,
<tcl><pre>
namespace foo {
   proc x {} {::tycho::inform {works}}
   ::tycho::inform [info which x]
   after idle [info which x]
}
</pre></tcl>
The first line defines a procedure "x", the second informs
us of its fully qualified name "::foo::x", and the third executes the fully
qualified name as a command at the global scope.
The following, by contrast, yields an error:
<tcl><pre>
namespace foo {
   proc x {} {::tycho::inform {works}}
   after idle "x"
}
</pre></tcl>
The same principle can be used in class definitions.
Consider the following:
<tcl><pre>
namespace foo {
   catch {delete class bar}
   class bar {
      constructor {args} {
         ::tycho::inform "Scheduling command: [info which z]"
         after idle [info which z]
      }
      proc z {} {::tycho::inform {works}}
   }
   bar y
}
</pre></tcl>
Notice that "z" here is a procedure, not a method.
A procedure does not need an instance of an object to be invoked.
Indeed, the command that we schedule using "after" is "::foo::bar::z",
which does not make any reference to any particular instance of the class "bar".
Thus, "info which" should not be used to access methods, but can be used
to access procedures.
<p>
<h3><a name="code command">Using the "code" command</a></h3>
<p>
The "code" command returns a scoped reference in the second form
described above, beginning with "@scope".
For example:
<tcl><pre>
namespace foo {
   proc x {} {::tycho::inform {works}}
   ::tycho::inform [code x]
   after idle [code x]
}
</pre></tcl>
In this case, the "[code x]" directive returns the list
"@scope ::foo x", which can be executed as a command at the global
scope.  It can also be used in class definitions.
For example:
<tcl><pre>
namespace foo {
   catch {delete class bar}
   class bar {
      constructor {args} {
         ::tycho::inform "Scheduling command: [code z]"
         after idle [code z]
      }
      proc z {} {::tycho::inform {works}}
   }
   bar y
}
</pre></tcl>
The command that is scheduled by "after" is
"@scope ::foo::bar z".
