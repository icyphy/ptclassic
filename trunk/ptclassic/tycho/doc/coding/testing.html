This page is primarily for Tycho Developers.  Some of the commands
mentioned below are not included in the Tycho distribution.

 <p>Places to go:

</MENU>

<H2><A NAME="test suite">Test Suite</A></H2>

We have included regression tests for some of the code.  Usually, 
wherever there is a Itcl file, the tests are in the <CODE>test</CODE>
directory.

<H3>Running the tests</H3>
There are several ways to run the tests:

<OL>

<LI> The <A
HREF="../../kernel/gui/doc/usersGuides/BuilderDialogHelp.html">BuilderDialog</A>
has a <CODE>Test</CODE> menu which has choices for the tests arranged
by directory.

<LI> Open a test file such as <A
HREF="../../kernel/basic/test/testStack.itcl"><CODE>$TYCHO/kernel/basic/test/testStack.itcl</CODE></A>  with Tycho and then evaluate the contents of the file with
the <CODE>Evaluate</CODE> choice from the <CODE>File</CODE> menu 
(<CODE>C-x C-r</CODE>).


<LI> The <A HREF="../../mk/tycommon.mk"><CODE>$TYCHO/mk/tycommon.mk</CODE></A>
file automagically generates two Itcl files:
<DL>
<DT> <CODE>all.itcl</CODE>
<DD> This file merely sources all of the <CODE>*.itcl</CODE> files in the
current directory.
<DT> <CODE>alltests.itcl</CODE>
<DD> This file sources all of the files that are listed as test files
in the <CODE>makefile</CODE>.

</DL>
After running <CODE>make sources</CODE>, you can open up either of these files
and then evaluate it, which will run all the tests in that directory.

<LI> <A HREF="../../kernel/gui/test/alltychotests.tcl"><CODE>$TYCHO/kernel/gui/test/alltychotests.tcl</CODE></A>

<br>  <CODE>alltychotests.tcl</CODE> will run all the <CODE>alltests.itcl</CODE>
files.  <CODE>$TYCHO/makefile</CODE> has two rules:
	<DL>
	<DT> <CODE>make alltests</CODE>
	<DD> Run all the tests in a vanilla <CODE>tycho</CODE>

	<DT> <CODE>make alltests.ptiny</CODE>
	<DD> Run all the tests in a <CODE>tycho -ptiny</CODE>

	</DL>
If you are on a machine that does not have <CODE>make</CODE>, you can try
<tcl><pre>
source [file join $TYCHO kernel gui test alltychotests.tcl]
</pre></tcl>
<LI> The tests can also be run by changing to a <CODE>test</CODE>
directory and typing <CODE>make</CODE> from a shell.  To try this out,
click on the Tcl code below:
<tcl><pre>
::tycho::execModal {make} "[file join $TYCHO kernel gui test]"
</pre></tcl>

<LI> The Tycho test suite can be run from the Tycho top-level
(<CODE>$TYCHO</CODE>) directory with the command: <CODE>make tests</CODE>

</OL>


<H3>Writing your own tests</H3>

The test suite infrastructure is based on the Itcl test suite code,
which is in turn based on the Tcl test suite code.  The 
<A HREF="../../edit/textedit/doc/usersGuides/EditItclHelp.html">Itcl Editor</A> has a <CODE>Test Template</CODE> under the <CODE>Special</CODE>
menu.  This menu choice loads the file
<A HREF="../../edit/textedit/templates/testTemplate.itcl"><CODE>$TYCHO/edit/textedit/templates/testTemplate</CODE></A> into the Itcl editor.


 <P>The file <A HREF="../../kernel/gui/test/testDefs.tcl"><CODE>$TYCHO/kernel/gui/test/testDefs.tcl</CODE></A> defines the Tcl proc <CODE>test</CODE>.

 <P><CODE>test</CODE> takes four arguments:
<OL>
<LI> The name of the test, for example: <CODE>foo-1.0</CODE>
  <br> The name of the test should strictly follow the format below.
	The Tcl tests that come with the Tcl distribution follow a similar
	format, so unless there is a strong need to not follow the format,
	please stick with what works.
	<MENU>
	<LI> The first part of
	name of the test should reflect the command that is
	being tested.  

	<LI> The test number should be separated by a dash '<CODE>-</CODE>'

	<LI> Each test number consists of a major value and a minor value,
	separated by a dot.  Usually the major value changes as different
	parts of the command are being tested.  The minor value changes
	for different tests for the particular part of the command under test.

	<LI> Test numbers usually start with <CODE>1</CODE>, though if
	you are
	doing setup, you can start with <CODE>0</CODE>.

	<LI> If you go back later and want to stick a test in between
	<CODE>foo-1</CODE> and <CODE>foo-2</CODE>, you can always call
	your new test <CODE>foo-1.1</CODE>
	</MENU>


<LI> The test description, usually a single sentence.

<LI> The contents of the test, usually Tcl code that does the action to
be tested.  The last line of the contents should return a value.

<LI> The results to be compared against.
</OL>

Below is a sample piece of code that sources the
<CODE>testDefs.tcl</CODE> file and then runs one test.  The code below
has the incorrect value return results to be compared against, so the
test suite properly indicates that the test failed.

<tcl><pre>
if {[string compare test [info procs test]] == 1} then { 
    source [file join $TYCHO kernel gui test testDefs.tcl]
} {}
test testExample-1.1 {This is the first test example, it does very little} {
	catch {this is an error} errMsg1
	set a "this is the value of a"
	list $errMsg1 $a
} {{invalid command name "this"} {this is NOT the value of a}}
</pre></tcl>

<H3>Parts of a test file</H3>
Test files should be located in the <CODE>test</CODE> directory.
 <P>The EditItcl class has a test file template menu choice under
the <CODE>Special</CODE> menu.  The template is located at

<A HREF="../../edit/textedit/templates/testTemplate.itcl"><CODE>$TYCHO/edit/textedit/templates/testTemplate.itcl</CODE></A>

 <P>It is better to have many small test files as opposed to a few
large test files so that other developers can quickly find the tests
for the class they are working with.  Usually tests for the class
<CODE>Foo</CODE> are found in the file <CODE>test/testFoo.itcl</CODE>

 <P>See <A HREF="../../kernel/gui/test/testGraph.itcl"><CODE>$TYCHO/kernel/gui/test/testGraph.itcl</CODE></A> for an example test file.

 <P>Each test file should have the following parts:
<OL>

<LI> The name of the test file should begin with the word <CODE>test</CODE>.
For example, if we were testing the Tcl <CODE>foo</CODE> command, then
the file would be named <CODE>testFoo.itcl</CODE>.  The extension of the file
is either <CODE>.tcl</CODE> or <CODE>.itcl</CODE>:
<MENU>
<LI> <CODE>.tcl</CODE> if the file can be sourced in a <CODE>tclsh</CODE>
	that does not contain Itcl.
	<CODE>$TYCHO/kernel/gui/test/testPath.tcl</CODE> is an example.

<LI> <CODE>.itcl</CODE> if the file contains Itcl constructs or tests
	Itcl classes. 
</MENU>
Most of the tests are <CODE>.itcl</CODE> files.

<LI> The Copyright

<LI> The code that loads the test system package
<PRE>
package require tycho.util.tytest
</PRE>


<LI> A line that the user can uncomment if they want the test system to
produce verbose messages:
<PRE>
#set VERBOSE 1
</PRE>


<LI> The individual tests, which should loosely follow the Tycho 
file format standard:
<PRE>
############################################################################
#### Foo
test Foo-1.1 {Test out Foo} {

} {}
</PRE>

</OL>

<H3><A NAME="test styles">Test Styles</A></H3>
There are two types of tests:
<OL>
<LI> Tests that handle all necessary setup in each individual test.

<LI> Tests that rely on the earlier tests to do setup.
</OL>

In general, each test file should be able to be run over and over again
in a binary without exiting the binary (it should be idempotent).  

 <P>It is up to the author of the tests as to whether each individual
test does all the set up necessary.  If each test is atomic, then it
makes it easy to highlight the text of an individual test and run it.
If lots of tests are sharing common setup, then using a separate
procedure to do setup might help.  On the negative side, atomic tests
usually are longer and have more complicated return results.

<H3><A NAME="testing modal dialog widgets">Testing Modal Dialog Widgets</A></H3>
Testing modal dialog widgets and the methods that use them is tricky because 
we want the test suite to be able to just 'do the right thing' and 
invoke the actions of an arbitrary method.

 <P>The problem is that when a model dialog box comes up, execution
halts, so during testing the user would need to know what button to
hit.  To work around this, the
<CODE>Dialog::wait</CODE> procedure (which is user to wait for
the result of all modal
dialog boxes in Tycho) 
checks for the <code>TY_TESTING</code>
global variable, to see if it has been called from within
a test script. If so, then <CODE>Dialog::wait</CODE> will not
actually make the dialog model but will do
one of two things:

<ul>
<li> If the global variable <code>TY_TEST_MODAL</code> exists
and is not null, then this is taken to be a list of
scripts. It will remove the first script from this list,
and evaluate it at the global scope with the name of the dialog box
substituted for every occurrence of the string <code>%0</code>. The
script should invoke methods of the dialog box to insert
data into the dialog and invoke buttons, as a user would
in normal usage. The return result from the call to
<CODE>Dialog::wait</CODE> will be the same as if
a user had invoked those operations and closed the modal
dialog. Because <CODE>Dialog::wait</CODE> removes
the script from <code>TY_TEST_MODAL</code>, successive calls
to <CODE>Dialog::wait</CODE> execute each script in the list
in succession, allowing tests to easily simulate user input
from a complex succession of dialog boxes. 

<li> If the global variable <code>TY_TEST_MODAL</code> does not
exist or  is null, then <CODE>Dialog::wait</CODE> just returns
the name of the dialog box.
</ul>

<p>
For example, the
<A HREF="../../kernel/gui/test/testWidgets.itcl"><CODE>$TYCHO/kernel/gui/test/testWidgets.itcl</CODE></A> script includes a test for <A HREF="../../kernel/gui/YesNoQuery.itcl"><CODE>YesNoQuery</CODE></A>:
<tcl><pre>
if {[string compare test [info procs test]] == 1} then { 
    source $TYCHO/kernel/gui/test/testDefs.tcl
} {}

test YesNoQuery-2.1 {Test the modal ::tycho::askuser proc} {
    set TY_TEST_MODAL {
        {
	    %0 invoke yes
	}
    }
    ::tycho::askuser "Are you awake?"
} 1
</pre></tcl>

<p> Note that <code>TY_TEST_MODAL</code> must be a list of
scripts, even if the list contains only one script. Here is
another sample test that simulates the user interaction to
a series of two dialog boxes.
The code being test is an example from
the <a href="../../kernel/gui/doc/internals/dialogclasses.html">
Dialog Classes</a> tutorial:

<tcl><pre>
if {[string compare test [info procs test]] == 1} then { 
    source $TYCHO/kernel/gui/test/testDefs.tcl
} {}

test sampleTest-1 {Test a series of modal dialogs} {
    # Set the series of response to the dialogs. The
    # first one clicks on the Yes button, the second clicks
    # on the OK button. Note that comments
    set TY_TEST_MODAL {
        {
            # This script simulates pressing the Yes button
            # of the YesNoQuery box
            %0 invoke yes
	}
        {
            # This script simulates pressing the OK button
            # of the Message box invoked by :tycho::inform
            %0 invoke ok
	}
    }
    # Now execute the code that creates the modal dialogs.
    # In this case, the result is null.
    ::tycho::YesNoQuery .z -text {Are you awake?}
    if [::tycho::Dialog::wait .z] {
        ::tycho::inform {You said yes!}
    } {
        ::tycho::inform {Then how did you click on the No button?}
    }
} {}
</pre></tcl>

<H3>Using <CODE>event generate</CODE></H3>

The Tk <CODE>event generate</CODE> command is very handy for testing
widgets by generating an event in a window as if it had come from the
window system.

 <P>The tests below are doing an <CODE>&lt;Enter&gt;</CODE> and
<CODE>&lt;Leave&gt;</CODE> of a button and checking the text placed
into a status bar:

<PRE>
update
test ButtonBox-3.3 {Enter button and check status bar} {
    event generate [.bb component buttonfoo] &lt;Enter&gt;
    .sb get
} {The Foo button}

update
test ButtonBox-3.4 {Leave the button} {
    event generate [.bb component buttonfoo] &lt;Leave&gt;
    .sb get
} {}
</PRE>


<H2>Writing Testable Code</H2>
Below are some hints about writing code that can be tested.
<MENU>
	<LI> If a method creates a window, and the window is present
	after the method ends, then the method should probably return
	the name of the window.  This makes it easier for callers
	and testing scripts to perform operations on the window.

	<LI> Separating interface and implementation can help.
	If a largish operation brings up lots of windows, it
	can help if there is a method that performs the interface
	operations which then calls a series of smaller methods.
	It is easier to test a series of small scripts than to
	test a large monolithic method.
</MENU>

<HR>
<H2><A NAME="testing documentation">Testing Documentation</A></H2>

The Tycho documentation is written in HTML.  There are several tools
that can be used.
<H3>weblint</H3>

Weblint tells the user about html errors.  Weblint can be obtained
from <A
HREF="ftp://ftp.cre.canon.co.uk/pub/weblint/weblint.tar.gz"><CODE>ftp://ftp.cre.canon.co.uk/pub/weblint/weblint.tar.gz</CODE></A>
To run <CODE>weblint</CODE>:
<PRE>
cd $TYCHO
make weblint
</PRE>

<H3>htmlchek</H3>

Htmlchek is another tool that tells the user about html errors.
<CODE>htmlchek</CODE> also checks for bad links.  The
<CODE>htmlchek</CODE> output is a little hard to read, so we tend to
use <CODE>weblint</CODE> for checking individual files.
<CODE>htmlchek</CODE> can be obtained from
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.cs.buffalo.edu/pub/htmlchek/"><CODE>ftp://ftp.cs.buffalo.edu/pub/htmlchek/</CODE></A>

<P> The best way to run <CODE>htmlchek</CODE> is to create a sample
distribution, create the files in the <CODE>codeDoc</CODE> directory
and then run <CODE>htmlchek</CODE>

<OL>
<LI> Create the test distribution:
<PRE>
cd /users/ptdesign/adm/gen-latest; make htmlchek
</PRE>

<LI> Reset <CODE>TYCHO</CODE> to point to the test distribution:
<PRE>
setenv TYCHO /users/ptdesign/adm/dists/tycho-latest
cd $TYCHO
</PRE>

<LI> Run <CODE>make install</CODE>.  This will make the Itcl HTML docs
twice, which will populate the <CODE>doc/codeDoc</CODE> directories.
You need to make the Itcl HTML docs twice so that the cross references are
correct.

<LI> Run <CODE>make htmlchek</CODE>

</OL>



The output ends up in five files
<MENU>
<LI> <CODE>htmlchekout.ERR</CODE> - HTML usage errors
<LI> <CODE>htmlchekout.NAME</CODE> - Locations in the specified files
that ware not referenced by any of those files
<LI> <CODE>htmlchekout.HREF</CODE> - References from the specified files
that are not found in the files.  This file is by far the most important
file to look at.
<LI> <CODE>htmlchekout.SRC</CODE> - References to online images.
<LI> <CODE>htmlchekout.MAP</CODE> - Cross dependency information.
</MENU>

<P> All of the references in <CODE>htmlchekout.HREF</CODE> that point
to <CODE>.html</CODE> files should be checked.  References to non-HTML
files appear in <CODE>htmlchekout.HREF</CODE> because the non-HTML
files were not included in the list of files that
<CODE>htmlchek</CODE> ran on.  One quick way to search all the the <CODE>*.html</CODE> files is
<PRE>
cd $TYCHO
grep mystring `find . -name "*.html" -print`
</PRE>

<H3>Spellchecking</H3>
Checking the spelling in all the HTML files can be done with:
<PRE>
cd $TYCHO
spell `find . -name "*.html" -print`
</PRE>
You can spell check an individual HTML file by using the HTML
editor built-in spell checker under the <CODE>Edit</CODE> menu.

<H3>Checking Embedded Tcl</H3>

Tycho extends html with <CODE>&lt;TCL&gt; . . . &lt;TCL&gt;</CODE>
tags.  In the Tycho HTML viewer, when the contents of these tags are
moused on, the embedded Tcl code is executed.

 <P>To test all of the embedded Tcl, the script
<CODE>$TYCHO/adm/bin/chktclpre</CODE> will generated a
<CODE>tclpre.html</CODE> file that contains all of the embedded Tcl.
This script is not shipped with Tycho.

 <P>After running <CODE>chktclpre</CODE>, start up Tycho, view
<CODE>tclpre.html</CODE> and mouse on each block of embedded Tcl code.
Note that some blocks depend on the widgets created in earlier blocks.
If you run into problems, you can follow the hyperlink in
<CODE>tclpre.html</CODE> to the source HTML file.


<H3>Checking for bogus copyright SCCS keywords</H3>

Run <CODE>~ptdesign/adm/copyright/chkq $TYCHO</CODE> to print out
the names of files that might have bogus <CODE>&#37;Q&#37;</CODE> values.
 <P>
Then run <CODE>~ptdesign/adm/bin/sccsadmin</CODE> on each file that
has no value for <CODE>&#37;Q&#37;</CODE>
substituted in.

<H3>Check the distribution for bogus files</H3>
Run the following makefile rules and commands:
<DL>
<DT> <CODE>make realclean</CODE>

<DD> This will remove the <CODE>tclIndex</CODE> files and the files in
<CODE>doc/codeDoc</CODE>.  The reason to remove the
<CODE>codeDoc</CODE> files is so that we don't ship HTML files for any
classes that have been removed.

<DT> <CODE>make install</CODE>
<DD> This will recreate the <CODE>tclIndex</CODE> files and the
<CODE>doc/codeDoc</CODE> files.

<DT> <CODE>make checkjunk</CODE>
<DD> Look for files in the distribution that should not be there.

<DT> <CODE>adm/bin/chkgifs</CODE>
<DD> This file looks for gif files that are not used by HTML files
in the distribution.

</DL> 

<H2><A NAME="testing the tycho script">Testing the tycho script</A></H2>

The <A HREF="../../bin/tycho"><CODE>$TYCHO/bin/tycho</CODE></A> script
can be tested with the <A
HREF="../../kernel/gui/test/chktycho"><CODE>$TYCHO/kernel/gui/test/chktycho</CODE></A>
script.

 <P>This script calls <CODE>tycho</CODE> with all the various
combinations of command line arguments.  <CODE>chktycho</CODE> adds a
line to <A
HREF="~/.Tycho/tychorc.tcl"><CODE>~/.Tycho/tychorc.tcl</CODE></A> so
that <CODE>tycho</CODE> is exited after a few seconds.  This allows
the script to test many invocations of <CODE>tycho</CODE> without user
intervention.  However to test the <CODE>-debug</CODE> option, the
user must type <CODE>cont</CODE> in the <CODE>gdb</CODE>window.
