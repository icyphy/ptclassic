<h1>Using the Tcl <CODE>update</CODE> command in Itcl</h1>
<p>
Calling the Tcl <a name=update><CODE>update</a></CODE> command ,
<a name=after><CODE>tkwait</a></CODE>, or even
<a name="update idletasks"><CODE>update idletasks</CODE></a>
within a method of any Itcl
object is very dangerous.  The Itcl object may be deleted during the
update, so when the update returns, you will be trying to execute a
method for an object that no longer exists.
<em>You must not call update in a method.</em>
At least in version 2.0 of Itcl, this can cause a core dump.
There are two alternatives: <code>safeUpdate</code> and <code>safeEval</code>.
<p>
<h3><a name="safeUpdate procedure"><CODE>safeUpdate</CODE> procedure</a></h3>
<p>
Tycho provides a method called
<code>::tycho::safeUpdate</code>
that takes a single argument, the name of an Itcl object.
It calls update.  If the object is deleted during
the call to <CODE>update</CODE>, then a
<a name="silent error">silent error</a> is triggered.
This means that <code>safeUpdate</code> will never return,
so execution does not continue within the calling thread.
A typical call within an Itcl method looks like this:
<pre>
     ::tycho::safeUpdate $this
</pre>
<p>
<h3><a name="silent error">Silent errors</a></h3>
<p>
A "silent error" is an ordinary error where no error message is
reported to the user, like a <CODE>throw</CODE> and <CODE>catch</CODE>
in some languages.
You can directly invoke a silent error with the following command:
<pre>
     ::tycho::silentError
</pre>
<p>
<h3><a name="safeEval"><CODE>safeEval</CODE> method</a></h3>
<p>
The three key Tycho base classes,
<code>Object</code>,
<code>TopLevel</code>, and
<code>TWidget</code> each have a protected method called
<code>safeEval</code>.
This method simply disables destruction of the object,
then evaluates its arguments, then re-enables destruction of the object.
It returns the result of evaluating the arguments.
Thus, if during evaluation of the arguments an attempt is made to destroy
the object, the attempt will be intercepted and deferred until after
evaluation of the arguments is complete.
<p>
The <code>safeEval</code> method should be used to invoke all modal
dialogs, as in the following example:
<pre>
    safeEval ::tycho::warn "this is a warning"
</pre>
