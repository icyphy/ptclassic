<p>
Tycho is an object-oriented syntax manager with
an underlying heterogeneous <a href="rationale.html">technical rationale</a>.
It provides a number of editors and graphical widgets
in an extensible, reusable framework.
A number of text editors with specialized features for various
languages are provided.
Editors for visual syntaxes will be more diverse.
The system documentation is integrated, using a hypertext
system compatible with the worldwide web.
Tycho was originally conceived for use with the
<a href=http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu>Ptolemy system</a>,
a heterogeneous design environment
from U.C. Berkeley, but it has grown into a system
that is useful on its own.
Tycho has been used extensively in the development of the Tycho
software itself.
<p>
Tycho is written primarily in <a name="Itcl">
Itcl</a>, also
called <a name="incr Tcl">[incr Tcl]</a>,
developed by by Michael McLennan of AT&amp;T.
Itcl is an object-oriented extension of <a name="Tcl">Tcl</a>,
a "tool command language" written by John Ousterhout of U.C. Berkeley
(now at Scriptics).
The window toolkit <a name="Tk">Tk</a> and its object-oriented
extension <a name="Itk">Itk</a> are also used extensively.
Information about Tcl, Tk, and Itcl can be found
at the <a href=http://www.tcltk.com/>tcltk web site</a>.
<p>
The key <a name="objectives">objectives</a> of the Tycho project are:
<p>
<ul>
<li> To build a genuinely object-oriented user interface, where multiple
visual syntaxes can be combined, and
application-specific visual syntaxes can be constructed.
<li> To provide an extensible framework for experimentation
with visual syntaxes, where mundane tasks such as documentation,
font management, color management, and dialogs with the user
are built using a shared, common infrastructure.
<li> To extend the non-dogmatic nature of the Ptolemy kernel (which
supports multiple semantic models) to the user interface (which will
support multiple syntactic models).
<li> To experiment with design visualization, broadening the
perspective beyond a schematic or block-diagram perspective of Ptolemy,
and exploring new visual and mixed visual/textual syntaxes
for design representation and understanding.
<li> To leverage off work in the Tcl/Tk community to get portable
code that runs on
Unix machines, <a name="Microsoft Windows">Microsoft Windows</a> PCs and
<a name="Apple Computer">Apple</a>
<a name="Macintosh">Macintoshes</a>.
<li> To design a sophisticated, extensible, interactive documentation
system.
</ul>
<p>
One of the key principles in Tycho is that anything can have a
<a name="hyperlinks">hyperlink</a>
to anything else.  Documentation will have links to source code,
and vice versa.  Visual editors will have links to textual editors.
And specialized displays can be created for any form of data.
These displays, of course, are also connected by hyperlinks.
<P>
The interface to Ptolemy kernel will eventually be entirely
through <A HREF="../typt/doc/internals/pitcl.html">pitcl</A>, the Tcl
extensions that provide an interpreted command language for the
Ptolemy kernel.
An interim mechanism is provided where Tycho forms a subsystem within
the much older visual editor for Ptolemy called <CODE>pigi</CODE> (which stands
for Ptolemy interactive graphical interface).
