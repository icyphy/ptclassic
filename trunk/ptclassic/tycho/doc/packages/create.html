<h1>How to create a new package</h1>
<p>

The simplest way to create a new package is to use the
<code>pakman</code> utility (currently under development).
By default, <code>pakman</code> creates a very small package
structure -- to make it create a package in the Tycho
format, give it the <code>-style tycho</code> option.

<p>To learn more about how to use <code>pakman</code>, go
read his documentation. If you want to know more about
why packages are created the way they or how to roll your own, read on!

<h2>What a package contains</h2>

Each package contains a file called <code>pkgIndex.tcl</code>
that looks like this:

<pre>
  package ifneeded tycho.<i>package</i> 2.0 \
      [list source [file join $dir <i>package</i>.tcl]]
</pre>

where <i>package</i> means the name of the package. What this
says is that when a startup script or another package
says something like:

<pre>
  package require tycho.<i>package</i>
</pre>

then the package load script named <code><i>package</i>.tcl</code> will be
sourced.  When a package is required, the package load script is
responsible for doing everything that is needed so that it can
operate. Here is the minimum necessary in the package load file:

<pre>
  package provide <i>package</i> 2.0
  global env
  set env(<i>PACKAGE</i>_LIBRARY) [file dirname [info script]]
  lappend auto_path $env(<i>PACKAGE</i>_LIBRARY)
</pre>

What this does is:
<ol>
<li>Tell Tcl which package it has just loaded
<li>Make <code>env</code> global in case this script is sourced
from a procedure.
<li>Set an environment variable that points to the source directory
of the package. This is a Tcl convention.
<li>Append the package directory to the <code>auto_path</code> variable
so that Tcl can load files automatically. (For this to work,
the directory must contain a valid <code>tclIndex</code> file.)
</ol>

<p>
The package load file can perform other actions.  Typical actions
include: creating a namespace for its procedures; performing a
<code>package require</code> for any packages that it depends upon; sourcing
Tcl or [incr Tcl] files then and there, to avoid the overhead of
auto-loading. Some people write Tcl packages in which the
package load file contains their actual Tcl source code.
We strongly recommend that this not be done: place Tcl and [incr 
Tcl] source in separate files, not in the package load file.

<h2>Making a meta-package</h2>

"Meta-package" is our corny term for a directory that
does nothing but contain a collection of real packages.
In the standard Tycho installation, the directories
<code>kernel</code>, <code>editors</code>, and <code>utils</code> are meta-packages.
In fact, Tycho itself is a meta-package.

<p>The purpose of a meta-package is simply to provide a way
to group packages in order to manage growth. In Tycho, because
we have quite a number of packages and developers that come
and go developing their own packages, this is important.
In your own development, you may not need meta-packages.

<p>
The only trick about meta-packages is that Tcl has to be told
about the packages contained inside it. Provided that Tcl can find
the meta-package (its directory or parent directory is in the
<code>auto_path</code> -- see <a href="install.html">Installing packages</a>),
the first <code>package require</code> will cause Tcl to source the
meta-package's <code>pkgIndex.tcl</code>. In order to tell Tcl about
the packages contained therein, just make the file contain this:

<pre>
catch {
    foreach file [glob -nocomplain [file join $dir * pkgIndex.tcl]] {
	set dir [file dirname $file]
	if [catch {source $file} msg] {
	    tclLog "error reading package index file $file: $msg"
	}
    }
}
</pre>

Bingo! Your packages will be found and the one given as the argument
to the <code>package require</code> will be loaded.  (By the way, this is
also the reason we recommend that stand-alone command-line-driven
packages not be in the Tycho meta-package: doing all that globbing and
sourcing does increase start-up time.)
