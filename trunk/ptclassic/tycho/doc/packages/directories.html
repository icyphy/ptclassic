<h1>Tycho's default layout</a></h1>
<p>

This is the standard layout of a full Tycho installation.  If you
install Tycho together with a number of packages, then you will get a
subset of this layout. You can also install the Tycho meta-package
only, and then add individual packages to the directory as you see
fit. In this case, you can place packages anywhere you like, as long
as the package searcher can find them.

<p>In the standard installation, packages are not installed in the
top-level directory, but underneath sub-directories called
<b>kernel/</b>, <b>editors/</b>, <b>util/</b>. This provides for
manageable growth in the number of packages.  The structure of each
package is given in <a href="structure.html">Package structure</a>.

<p>By convention, each package that is a proper part of Tycho has a
name such as <B>tycho.kernel.gui</B>, to mimic the Java convention of
placing packages by directory. The Tcl package system, of course, does
not understand this convention, so in a non-standard installation you
can place the packages anywhere you please. Some packages in the
<B>util</B> directory are completelt stand-alone, and so have simple
names such as <B>obstcl</B>.

<P>Note that you do not need to install the Tycho framework to use
Tycho packages. As long as you have all the packages you require, you
can install them in your own directories in any way you choose.
