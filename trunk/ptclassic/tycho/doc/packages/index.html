<h1>Tycho's Package System</a></h1>
<p>

Tycho is structured as a set of independently installable and
releasable packages. The package mechanism is a simple extension to
the Tcl package mechanism to support nested packages.  The mechanism
is designed to allow installation and loading of arbitrary subsets of
Tycho. Tycho can thus be used as:

<ul>

<li>A "stand-alone" application, with its own console and feature
support. Other packages can be easily added to Tycho.

<li>An application framework for other stand-alone applications. Some
of Tycho's packages implement dedicated applications that use Tycho in
this way.

<li>A utility library for existing [incr Tcl] applications.

<li>A package management framework for other [incr Tcl] applications.

</ul>

Tycho has a standard package structure, and a standard directory
structure for a full Tycho installation. However, the package system
is flexible enough to allow you to use Tycho to manage your own
packages, if you wish.
