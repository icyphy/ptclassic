<h1>Where to install a package</a></h1>
<p>

Generally, if you have installed the complete Tycho
distribution, then you have nothing more to do.
If you have downloaded an independent Tycho package or
want to modify your installation, you might find
some useful information here.

<p>
In general, a Tcl script that is supplied with a Tycho packages
tries to do try several things to attempt to load required packages:

<ol>
<li>Require the packages. This will work if packages have
been installed into the Tcl library directory.
To see what directory this is, simply start <code>itclsh</code>
and enter

<pre>
  file dirname [info library]
</pre>

<p>
<li>Search the sub-directories of the directory given by the
environment variable <code><i>PACKAGE</i>_LIBRARY</code>, where
<code><i>PACKAGE</i></code> is the name of the package in upper-case.
This is generally only useful for small, self-contained
packages.

<p>
<li>Search the sub-directories of the directories given
by the environment variable <code>TCL_PACKAGES</code>. Again,
this is mostly useful for small, self-contained packages.

<p><li>Search the sub-directories of the directories given
by the environment variable <code>TYCHO</code>. Assuming that this
directory points to an installation of Tycho, this will cause
every single package in the Tycho tree to be located.

</ol>

Mostly, the first three options are useful if you have downloaded one
of the standalone packages, and startup time is important -- if the
package is installed in the Tycho tree, then large chunks of the tree
are scanned checking for packages that you aren't even going to need.
