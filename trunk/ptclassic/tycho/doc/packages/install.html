<h1>How to install a package</a></h1>
<p>

How you install a package depends on what you want to do.  If you have
downloaded a full Tycho installation and installed it following the
instructions and are happy with it, then you have nothing more to
do. If, however, you have downloaded one or more individual packages,
or want to optimize your installation (or you just want to know why we
did what we did), read on!

<p>
The shell scripts that are supplied with the various Tycho
packages to do something useful generally try four things to attempt
to load required packages:

<ol>
<li>Require the packages. This will work if packages have
been installed into the Tcl library directory.
To see what directory this is, simply start <code>itclsh</code>
and enter

<pre>
  file dirname [info library]
</pre>

<p>
<li>Search the sub-directories of the directory given by the
environment variable <code><i>PACKAGE</i>_LIBRARY</code>, where
<code><i>PACKAGE</i></code> is the name of the package in upper-case.
This is generally only useful for small, self-contained
packages.

<p>
<li>Search the sub-directories of the directories given
by the environment variables <code>TCL_PACKAGES</code>. Again,
this is mostly useful for small, self-contained packages.

<p><li>Search the sub-directories of the directories given
by the environment variables <code>TYCHO</code>. Assuming that this
directory points to an installation of Tycho, this will cause
every single package in the Tycho tree to be located.

</ol>

What does this mean, in terms of installing packages? It depends on
what kind of packages you are installing, and what you already have.
Here are the two main scenarios:

<ul>

<li>The package is a graphical application, and you already have a
Tycho installation and your <CODE>TYCHO</CODE> environment variable is
set. Just install it into the Tycho directory, either at the top
level, or into one of the subdirectories <code>kernel</code>,
<code>editors</code>, or <code>utils</code>, as appropriate.

<p>
<li>The package is a stand-alone application and
startup time is important. Either:

<ol>
<li>Install it into the Tcl library directory (described above), or
<li>Install it into the directory pointed to by your
<code>TCL_PACKAGES</code> environment variable, or
<li>Install is anywhere you like and set the environment variable
<code><i>PACKAGE</i>_LIBRARY</code> to point to it.

</ol>
</ul>

If neither of these scenarios fits, then it's simply a matter of
making one fit (!). The simplest approach is to create a Tycho
installation by downloading the Tycho framework package and
installing it. This will give you a Tycho directory in which
to install packages.

<p>Alternatively, you can simply install all packages into the
directory pointed to by <CODE>TCL_PACKAGES</CODE>. For some Tycho applications,
you will need the Tycho framework package anyway.

<p>The reason why stand-alone command-line applications are better
installed independently of Tycho is the start-up time. If the package
is installed in the Tycho tree, then large chunks of the tree are
scanned checking for out packages that you aren't even going to
need. Installing in the Tcl library or a separate, smaller, directory,
avoids this.
