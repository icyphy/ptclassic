<h1>Tycho's Package System</a></h1>
<p>

Tycho is structured as a set of independently installable and
releasable packages. The package mechanism is a simple extension to
the Tcl package mechanism to support nested packages.  The mechanism
is designed to allow installation and loading of arbitary subsets of
Tycho. Tycho can thus be used as:

<ul>

<li>A "stand-alone" application, with its own console and feature
support. Other packages can be easily added to Tycho.

<li>An application framework for other stand-alone applications. Some
of Tycho's packages implement dedicated applications that use Tycho in
this way.

<li>A utility library for existing [incr Tcl] applications.

<li>A package management framework for other [incr Tcl] applications.

</ul>

<a name="The top-level Tycho package"><h2>The top-level Tycho package</h2></a>

<p>
The Tycho package is the top-level package, and will always be
installed if you are using any of the Tycho packages (except those
that are noted to be completely independent of Tycho). The Tycho
package includes a few [incr Tcl] files that are used for installing
and locating packages, and for starting up Tycho as a stand-alone
application.  The Tycho package is usually contained in a directory
named <b>tycho</b> (the generic name) or something like
<b>tycho0.2.1devel</b> (the current development version).

<p>The Tycho package provides the "bootstrap" mechanism that finds all
other packages contained within the <b>tycho</b> directory. (Note that
Tycho packages do not <i>have</i> to be installed into the
<b>tycho</b> directory, as long as Tcl can find them -- installing
them into <b>tycho</b>, however, guarantees that they will be found!)
When a script executes a <b>package require</b> command, and the
required package is not yet known to Tcl, Tcl will find the
<b>tycho</b> directory and source the file <b>pkgIndex.tcl</b>. This
file in turn searches the <b>tycho</b> directory for packages.

<p>In order to make sure that Tcl can find the <b>tycho</b>
directory, either that directory or its parent must be
in the tcl variable <b>auto_path</b>. Here are two ways to
ensure that this is so:

<ol>
<li>Install tycho in the Tcl library directory.
To see what directory this is, simply start <b>itclsh</b>
and enter

<pre>
  file dirname [info library]
</pre>

<b>itkwish</b>, when started, will know about all
packages in the <b>tycho</b> directory. <b>itclsh</b>
will not, so scripts that run in <b>itclsh</b> will need
to do a <b>package require Tycho</b> before attempting
to load any other Tycho packages.

<p>

<li>
Install Tycho in some other directory and set the TYCHO environment
variable. Scripts that start up Tycho in <b>itkwish</b> or
<b>itclsh</b> need to do something like this:

<pre>
  lappend auto_path $env(TYCHO)
</pre>

before doing a <b>package require</b> on any Tycho
packages. All of the scripts provided in the standard
Tycho installation for running Tycho stand-alone
check for the TYCHO environment variable before
requiring Tycho packages.

</ul>

<a name="Tycho's standard packages"><h2>Tycho's standard packages</h2></a>

Tycho contains a number of packages that provide varying level of
support for [incr Tcl] development and "application"-level classes
such as textual and graphical editors and development tools. The
packages that most Tycho installations will include are (apart
from the top-level Tycho package):

<dl>
<dt><b>Make</b>
<dd>The Make package provides a make-like facility for
platforms that do not support make. It also makes
it easier to write Tcl installation and configuration
scripts. Make does not depend on Tycho, and can be installed
independently.

<dt><b>Kernel</b>
<dd>The Kernel package provides the non-graphical support
used by most Tycho applications. It includes a number
of regular Tcl procs, and classes that assist construction
of [incr Tcl] applications.

<dt><b>TFC</b>
<dd>The TFC -- Tycho Foundation Classes -- package provides
a framework for developing graphical [incr Tcl} applications.
It has extensive support for file management, style preferences,
text editing, dialog boxes, and so on.

</dl>

Tycho's other packages, which you may or may not want to install, include
<b>TextEdit</b>, <b>VisEdit</b>, <b>HTML</b>, <b>Slate</b>,
<b>ITools</b>, and <b>IDoc</b>.

<p>Note that you do not have to install any of these packages:
the top-level Tycho package can be used simply as a convenient
way of structuring your own packages, if you wish.

<a name="Location of Tycho packages"><h2>Location of Tycho packages</h2></a>

Packages can be located anywhere within the Tycho directory,
provided that the package searcher can find them. In order
to make sure that this is so, each package must
<ol>
<li>Contain a <b>pkgIndex.tcl</b> file, and
<li>Be a sub-directory of the <b>tycho</b> directory or of
a directory that can be found by the package searcher.
</ol>

The simplest method is simply to make each package a
sub-directory of the <b>tycho</b> directory. However, to
facilite the creation of arbitrarily and irritatingly
deep directory hierarchies, a package can be placed in
any directory that has a <b>pkgIndex.tcl</b> file.
In the standard Tycho installation, for example, the
directory <b>tycho/editors</b> contains an empty
<b>pkgIndex.tcl</b>, and there are several packages
contained within that directory. All of these packages
will be found by the package searcher.

<p>If you have Tycho installed, and you are creating your
own [incr Tcl] application, you can create a package within
the 

<a name="Making a Tycho package">
<h2>Making a Tycho package</h2>
</a>

Tycho packages follow the standard rules for Tcl packages.
In each package, create a <b>pkgIndex.tcl</b> file. Typically,
this file contains something like this:

<pre>
  package ifneeded Kernel 0.1 \
	[list source [file join $dir kernel.tcl]]
</pre>

where <b>Kernel</b> is the name of the package, <b>0.1</b>
is its version number, and <b>kernel.tcl</b> is the
package load file (see below).

<p>
In that same directory, create the package load file,
which will be sourced in response to a <b>package require</b>
on that package. This file typically contains something
like this:

<pre>
  package require Tycho
  package provide Kernel 0.1
  lappend auto_path [file dirname [info script]]
  set ::tycho::packages(Kernel) [file dirname [info script]]
</pre>

The first line states this package requires the top-level Tycho
package. Packages that implement graphical applications will typically
require the TFC package instead of Kernel.

<p>The second line tells Tcl that Kernel is being provided.  The third
ensure that the files in the package can now be auto-loaded on
demand.

<p>The final line is required so that Tycho installation and
configuration scripts know what directory the package was loaded
from. Additional initialization code can be added after that -- for
example, applications packages typically call the
<b>::tycho::register</b> procedure in TFC to associate file extensions
with code to open files with those extensions.


<a name="Using Tycho packages"><h2>Using Tycho packages</h2></a>

Any script that starts Tycho, whether as a stand-alone
application or as a part of another application, will need
to do a <b>package require</b> on at least one Tycho
package. There are three main cases:

<dl>
<dt><b>Running Tycho as a stand-alone application</b>

<dd>In this mode, you
are interested in starting Tycho as an application. By
default, Tycho will start with a splash screen, and then
come up with a command-line console and menus that
access features of all loaded packages. The simplest
method is to simply do:

<pre>
  package require Tycho
  ::tycho::start
</pre>

This loads the top-level Tycho package, and then calls
a procedure that starts Tycho as an application. <b>::tycho::start</b>
takes arguments that can be used to control how Tycho starts
and what packages it loads. By default, it loads all known
Tycho packages, but this can be turned off. If the script
has been started as a shell script, then the procedure
<b>::tycho::processCommandLine</b> can be used to
convert command-line arguments into a form suitable for
use by <b>::tycho::start</b>.

<p>
<dt><b>Running Tycho as an application framework for another
stand-alone application</b>

<dd>In this mode, you want to run a program
that uses the facilities of Tycho, but which has its own
"personality" that you provided. Usually, you will have
written a package that makes calls on the Tycho Kernel
or TFC packages, and that contains one or more start-up scripts
in its <b>scripts</b> sub-directory. In the start-up script for your
application, simply require your own package, and then either:

<ul>
<li>Require the needed Tycho packages. This is useful
when you have multiple strtup scripts that use
different parts of Tycho.
<li>Have your package load file require the needed
Tycho packages. This is useful when your package always
required the same set of Tycho packages.
</ul>

For example, a non-graphical utility would call

<pre>
  package require Kernel
</pre>

while a graphical utility would call at least
<pre>
  package require TFC
</pre>

Some utilities may require other Tycho packages; as long
as they are installed, the application can load them
with, for example,
<pre>
  package require HTML
  package require Slate
</pre>

A number of the Tycho packages themselves provide
stand-alone applicatins in this manner. For example,
the scripts that generate class diagrams and
extract documentation from code do this.

<p>
<dt><b>Using Tycho packages as utility packages</b>

<dd>In this mode, your stand-alone application simple loads
parts of Tycho as and when required. For example, you may
have written an [incr Tcl] application that can be enhanced
with the Tycho Slate and HTML packages. Simply execute

<pre>
  package require Slate
  package require HTML
</pre>
before attempting to use the facilities of these packages,
and these facilities will be loaded for use by your application.
