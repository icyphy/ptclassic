<p>
Theoreticians typically strive for simplicity, looking for the smallest
set of primitives on which they can build a general methodology.
In computer science theory, for example, numerous languages have
been devised that reflect this ideal by providing in a few primitives
an expressive power at least equivalent to Turing machines.
Practitioners view such efforts the way they view Turing machines: they
make an interesting abstraction, but they don't tell us much about how
to build systems. To a practitioner, the value of a language lies in
its utility, and both excessive simplicity and excessive complexity can
interfere with its utility.
<p>
A reasonable way to balance the pressures of breadth and simplicity is
to support heterogeneity.  This implicitly recognizes the usefulness of
small, specialized languages and tools. For example, the
programming language embodied in a typical spreadsheet program is
extremely useful. But it is certainly not general, in that there are
many applications for which it is inappropriate. Such tools are
therefore most useful if they can be combined with other specialized
tools. Each tool is developed independently, making the development
effort manageably small. But by embedding the tool in an environment
with appropriate interfaces between tools, the utility of the tool is
greatly magnified. 
<p>
Looser integration of diverse tools and capabilities has numerous advantages.
Existing, familiar tools do not need to be discarded in favor of a
new, all-encompassing tool. This is particularly valuable when
expertise with complex tools has built up over time.
Moreover, capabilities can come in "bite sized" modules, making them easier
to learn, and rendering them more acceptable to a conservative clientele.
For commercial software, tools
from different vendors can be mixed, drawing from the
strengths of each.
This has the side effect that
competition among vendors is enhanced because fewer customers are
"locked in". This results in better tools at lower prices.
Finally, accepted environments supporting heterogeneity means that
innovative tools with specialized capabilities have a market. They
do not need to be all-encompassing to be salable. So innovation is
encouraged.  This concept has been proven with the notion of
"plug-ins" available for a number of commercial software platforms.
<p>
There are also significant disadvantages.
User interfaces are likely to be different with different tools,
making them more difficult to learn.
And integration may not be complete.
<p>
The Tycho project is trying to maximize the advantages and minimize
(though probably not eliminate) the disadvantages.
Our group has a history of embracing heterogeneity in this manner.
The Ptolemy software system, which has been under
development at U.C. Berkeley since 1990, addresses the problem of
mixing "models of computation", or semantic models, in system-level
design of electronic systems. The Tycho
system addresses the problem of mixing syntactic models. For example, while
Ptolemy can support mixtures of discrete-event and dataflow modeling,
Tycho can support mixtures of textual and graphical syntaxes.
<p>
In both Ptolemy and Tycho, the goals are accomplished through a
strict and carefully designed object-oriented software architecture.
A key principal is that of "information hiding".  Objects should
be able to interact with one another without knowing about either
their internal semantic or syntactic models.
