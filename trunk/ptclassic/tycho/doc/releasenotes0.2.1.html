Tycho is an object-oriented <em>syntax manager</em> with
an underlying heterogeneous <a href="rationale.html">technical rationale</a>.
It provides a number of editors and graphical widgets
in an extensible, reusable framework.
The editors for textual syntaxes are modeled after 
<a name="emacs">emacs</a> in
the sense the emacs key bindings are used when possible.
Editors for visual syntaxes will be more diverse.
	
The system documentation is integrated, using a hypertext
system compatible with the worldwide web.
Tycho is designed to provide the user interface for other programs.
At Berkeley, it is used with the Ptolemy system, a
heterogeneous design environment. It is also useful on its own
as a software development environment.  The development of Tycho
has proceeded almost entirely within the Tycho environment since
its very early days.
<p>
Version 0.2.1 is the fourth public release of Tycho as a standalone system.
It runs under the vanilla Itcl 3.0 with no changes to the executable.
(Note that Ptolemy 0.7 and 0.7.1 were shipped with Itcl2.2.
Tycho0.2.1 will not work with Itcl2.1.)
<p>
Tycho0.2.1 includes both textual and graphical editors.
<p>
Tycho0.2.1 can be obtained from 
<a href="http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/tycho/Tycho.html">
<code>http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/tycho/Tycho.html</code></a>
<p>
Here is a summary of the capabilities:
<h3>Tycho Kernel</h3>
<ul>
	<li> A family of dialog windows, including basic message
	windows (both modal and non-modal), yes-no queries, queries
	for text entry, and queries with radio buttons.

	<li> A list browser and derived file browser and index browser.
	These browsers support pattern-based search.
	
	<li> An Emacs-like text editing widget that significantly
	extends the capabilities of the Tk text widget, including a
	search capability, undo/redo, text filling, and carefully
	designed menus and key bindings.
	
	<li> A shell-like console for interacting with Tcl with a
	history mechanism fashioned after the Unix tcsh.
	
	<li> An integrated documentation system based on HTML with automatic
	index generation and an index search mechanism.
	
	<li> Support for hyperlinks from any Tycho editor or display
	to any other Tycho editor or display.
	
	<li> An interface to the compiler and make for C, C++ and Java.
	C and C++ compiler errors are mouse sensitive hyperlinks. 
	
	<li> A context-sensitive spelling checker (for example, it
	checks the spelling only in comments when editing code).
	
	<li> Interfaces to SCCS and RCS revision control systems.
	
	<li> A font management system that includes an interactive dialog for
	selecting fonts.
	
	<li> A user preferences system.
	
	<li> An interface to the Glimpse index browser, which can
	rapidly search large directory trees for textual patterns.
	
	<li> Error handling with a stack display.
	
	<li> Auto-save.
	
	<li> Some elementary data structures: Stack, CircularList, Graph,
	DirectedAcyclicGraph, Forest.
</ul>
<p>
<h3>Textual Editors and Shells</h3>
<p>

In addition to the basic Emacs-like text editor described above and
the Tcl shell, a number of additional editors and shells have been
designed.
The editors provide capabilities similar to those of Emacs modes,
although they have the potential to go beyond Emacs modes because of
the planned inclusion of graphical elements.
<p>
The editors and shells included in release 0.2.1 are:
<p>
<ul>
	<li> HTML editor.  This editor parses HTML commands, supports
	hyperlinks, and provides a command to check the validity of
	hyperlinks.

	<li> HTML viewer.  This viewer is based on Stephen Uhler's
	html_library3.0, but has been tuned for performance.
	The HTML viewer current starts netscape if it is passed a URL,
	although future versions of Tycho will directly support HTTP.
	
	<li> Itcl and Tcl editors.  These editors color and fill
	comments, handle indentation, and color class, procedure, and
	method names. 
	They also support "evaluate" commands, where a selected region,
	a method or procedure body, or the entire file can be evaluated.

	<li> Java editor.  It includes menu choices to run
	<CODE>appletviewer</CODE>, and to compile Java files.

	<li> C and C++ editors.  These color and fill comments and
	handle indentation, and include a menu choices to compile files.

	<li> Makefile editor.  This editor colors comments, variable
	definitions, variable references, rules, and various
	directives.
	
	<li> Ptlang editor.  This is an editor for designing new functional
	elements (stars) for the Ptolemy system.
	
	<li> Esterel editor. 
	
	<li> Matlab and Mathematica consoles.  These will only appear
	if the appropriate Tcl extensions for interaction with Matlab
	and Mathematica have been installed.
	
	<li> A viewer for Unix diff output.

</ul>
<H3>Graphical Editors</H3>
<ul>
	<li> EditDAG - Directed Acyclic Graph Editor
	<li> EditForest - Forest Editor (a forest is a collection of trees)
	<li> EditPalette - Prototype of a Ptolemy Palette editor
	<li> EditSTD - State Transition Diagram editor
	<li> Slate - Object oriented extension to the Tk Canvas
	<li> ProfileTcl - Tcl Profiler that uses the TclX profiler and
	displays the results graphically.

</ul>
	
<h3><code>tydoc</code> - The Tycho documentation system</h3>

Tycho 0.2.1 also includes <code>tydoc</code>, a script that converts
itcl to html.

<H2><A NAME="tycho 0.2.1 changes">Changes between Tycho 0.2 and Tycho 0.2.1</A></H2>
<ul>
<li> <a href="packages/index.html">Tycho Package System</a>
The Package system resulted in a reorganization of the directory structure.

<li> HTML widget can now access web pages over the internet.

</ul>

</H2>

<UL>

<LI> The following features that were present in 0.2 were removed
in 0.2.1
<menu>
<li> The TclJava interface -
Tcl Blend, the new interface from Sun only runs under Tcl 8.
TclJava is buggy and obsolete, so we have removed it.

<li> Profile - The Profile command used an out of date
version of the TclX profiler.
</menu>
