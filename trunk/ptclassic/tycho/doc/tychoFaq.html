<H1><A NAME="FAQ">Tycho FAQ</A></H1>

The information below is convered in the Tycho documentation, we
present it here in a slightly different format.

<H2>General</H2>

<DL>
<DT> <B>What Is Tycho?</B>

<DD> At first glance, Tycho is a extensible Itcl development
environment.  We plan to use Tycho in the Ptolemy project (see <A
HREF="http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu"><CODE>http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu</CODE></A>.

 <P>The two primary features that Itcl developers will find interesting
are the Itcl profiler and the graphical class browser.

<DT> <B>What Is Itcl?</B>

<DD> Itcl is short hand for <CODE>[incr tcl]</CODE> which is an object
oriented version of the Tool Command Language (tcl).  Tcl was written
by John Ousterhout, Itcl was written by Michael McLennan.

<DT> <B>How do I download Tycho?</B>
<DD> <A HREF="http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/tycho/Tycho.html"><CODE>http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/tycho/Tycho.html</CODE></A> has instructions and Itcl binaries.

<DT> <B>What platforms does Tycho run under?</B>
<DD> We do our development work under Solaris2.5.1.  Tycho has been run
under WindowsNT, but some of the features that use <CODE>exec</CODE> are
broken.

<H2>Why didn't you . . .</H2>

<DL>
<DT> <B>Why didn't you just use emacs?</B>
<DD> FSF Emacs is not particularly graphical, though xemacs is better.
We want to be able to have active graphical widgets embedded in text.


<DT> <B>Why didn't you use the Iwidgets widgets everywhere?</B>
<DD> This was a design decision made by the Tycho authors.  In some
cases, we decided to use a simpler widget.  In other cases the
functionality we needed was missing.  We also wanted the widget we
wrote to use some of the features of Tycho, such as automatically
generated documentation and active tcl examples.

<DT> <B>Why didn't you use Java?</B>
<DD> When we started Tycho, Java was still very new.  Currently, we
don't know of a good canvas like Java class like the tk canvas.  We'd
rather not reinvent the wheel here and write our own Java canvas.  We
are looking into integrating Java and Tycho.
