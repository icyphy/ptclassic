Tycho is designed to be used as a stand-alone program or on
conjunction with the Ptolemy system.  The Ptolemy system is a
heterogeneous design environment developed at U.C. Berkeley.  We do
most of our development under Solaris2.5, so Tycho will probably work
best under that operating system.


<h2><a name="setup under Unix">Setup</a></h2>

To <A NAME="setup">setup</A> Tycho under Unix, you will need to
download Tycho from the Tycho home page at <A
HREF="http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/tycho/Tycho.html"><CODE>http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/tycho/Tycho.html</CODE></A>
has a link to the downloads page that contains Tycho sources and Itcl
binaries for certain Unix platforms.

 <p>Tycho0.1.1 will not work with Itcl2.0, which is the version
shipped with Ptolemy0.6.  To use Tycho0.1.1, you must have Itcl2.1 or
Itcl2.2 installed.

 <P>To check the version number of Tycho, look at the startup screen
that has the 'Mr. Tycho' bitmap.  The startup screen can be brought up by 
selecting the <CODE>Help</CODE> menu in the upper right side and then selecting
<CODE>About</CODE>.  You can also type
type
<tcl><pre>
puts $TychoVersionInfo
</pre></tcl>
into a Tycho console.
(If you are running tycho, you can just mouse on the tcl command
above and the version information will be printed in the Console
window).

 <P>You will also need to have the <CODE>tycho/bin</CODE> directory in
your path.  In addition, you will need to set an <a name="environment
variables">environment variable</a> <a name="TYCHO environment
variable"><CODE>TYCHO</CODE></a> to point to the installation
directory for Tycho.

 <P>For example, if Tycho is installed in
<CODE>/usr/tools/tycho</CODE> and Itcl is installed in
<CODE>/usr/tools/itcl/bin</CODE>, then you could put the following
lines in your <CODE>.cshrc</CODE> file (assuming you use csh):

<pre>
    set path = (/usr/tools/tycho/bin /usr/tools/itcl/bin $path)
    setenv TYCHO /usr/tools/tycho
</pre>

The <CODE>TYCHO</CODE> environment variable can also be used to
control which of several versions of Tycho you run, if you have more
than one version installed on your system.

<p>
<h2><a name="standalone execution">Standalone Execution</a></h2>
<p>
To use Tycho standalone (independent of Ptolemy),
the command-line syntax is:
<pre>
    tycho [-nowelcome] [-noconsole] [-debug] [file...]
</pre>

All arguments and options are optional.
One or more file names may be optionally specified as arguments.
If you specify one or more files, those files will be opened by Tycho.
Tycho will exit when you close all windows.
If you do not specify any files, Tycho opens with a Tcl
<a name="console window">console window</a>.
You can type Tcl, Tk, or Itcl commands into this console window.
You may also open other files from this window.
Exiting this console window will exit the program.
This console window also captures
<a name="standard output">standard output</a> generated with the
Tcl <a name="puts command"><CODE>puts</CODE> command</a>, unless that
output is directed to a file.
If you give the -nowelcome option, then you will not get the startup
<a name="welcome window">welcome window</a>.
This is particularly useful if you are running
over a slow X connection (like a modem) and do not wish to waste
the bandwidth.

The <a name="-debug tycho option">-debug</a> option will bring up
<CODE>itkwish</CODE> inside the Gnu GDB debugger.

<p>
<h2><a name="Ptolemy with Tycho">Executing Tycho with Ptolemy</a></h2>
<p>
If you are running Ptolemy version 0.6 or higher, then
Tycho is already running when you run the user interface <CODE>pigi</CODE>.
You can obtain a Tycho console window with the key binding "y".
You can also run Tycho with the Ptolemy textual interpreter, 
<CODE>ptcl</CODE>.
The command-line syntax for this is:
<pre>
    tycho [-debug] [-ptiny|-ptrim|-pigi|-bin tychobin] &#92
          [-nowelcome] [-noconsole] [file...]
</pre>
All options and arguments are optional.
The options are interpreted as follows:
<dl>
<dt><CODE>-debug</CODE>
<dd>
Start a version of Ptolemy with debugging symbols, if one is available.  
<dt><CODE>-ptiny</CODE><dd>
Start a minimal version of Ptolemy with only the SDF, DE, and HOF domains.
<dt><CODE>-ptrim</CODE><dd>
Start an intermediate version of Ptolemy with a few of the most useful
domains (SDF, BDF, DDF, DE, CGC, and HOF).
<dt><CODE>-pigi</CODE><dd>
Start a large version of Ptolemy with all domains.
<dt><CODE>-bin</CODE> <CODE><I>tychobin</I></CODE><dd>
Start a particular, specified executable.
<dt><CODE>-nowelcome</CODE><dd>
Do not open the initial welcome window.
<dt><CODE>-noconsole</CODE><dd>
Do not open a console window.
<dt><CODE><I>file...</I></CODE><dd>
Open the specified files after starting the program.
</dl>
<p>
Notice that the <CODE>-ptiny</CODE>, <CODE>-ptrim</CODE>,
<CODE>-pigi</CODE>, and <CODE>-bin</CODE>
options are mutually
exclusive.
If no files are specified, then the program opens with a Tcl console
window into which you can type Tcl, Tk, or Itcl commands.
Exiting this console window will exit the program (after confirmation).
If you do specify files, then closing all open windows will exit
the program.
In either case, you can also exit the program with the "Quit"
command in any File menu.
<p>
The directory <A HREF="../typt"><CODE>$TYCHO/typt</CODE></A>
contains the Ptolemy specific Tycho features.  The <A
HREF="../typt/doc/usersGuides/index.html">typt User's Guides</A>
documentation is a good starting point.
<h2><a name="debugging Tycho with Ptolemy">Debugging Tycho with Ptolemy</a></h2>

<p> Since Ptolemy is a fundamentally extensible system, Tycho running
with Ptolemy has special features to allow experimentation and
debugging.  One feature is that it traps segmentation faults and
related errors that cause the program to crash, and attempts to save
any unsaved work before exiting.  Of course, there is no guarantee
that this will work, so files are saved with the prefix
<CODE>#crash#</CODE> . When the file is reopened Tycho will check to
see if a <CODE>#crash#</CODE> file exists, and if it does, give the
user the option of opening it.

<p>

<h2><a name="customizing Tycho on startup">Customizing Tycho on Startup
</a></h2>

<p> You can configure Tycho to execute some Tcl code on startup.
Simply create a <a name=".Tycho directory"> directory called
<CODE>.Tycho</CODE></a>in your home directory and a file called <a
name="tychorc.tcl file"><CODE>tychorc.tcl</CODE> </a> in that
directory.  That file will automatically be sourced on startup.  Note
that the <CODE>.Tycho</CODE> directory is used to store other state
information for Tycho, such as your personal dictionary for spelling
checks.
