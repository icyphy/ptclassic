<h1>How interactors work</h1>



<p> <i>Interactors</i> package common patterns of user interaction
into reusable objects.  They are a mechanism originally developed in
Brad Meyer's Garnet system.  The Slate's interactors are much smaller,
lighter, and more numerous than the interactors in Garnet.  They are
also known as "manipulators" in other systems (and this would perhaps
be a better name, since the Slate's interactors are much less general
than Garnet's and apply only to graphical items on the Slate).  The
Slate's interactors are designed to be easy to combine to create
complex patterns of interaction from simpler ones.  Interactors are
built on top of Tk's event-handling mechanism.

<p> Each sub-class of <i>Interactor</i> implements a particular kind of 
user interaction.  Most interactors are based on the observation that 
user interactions can be broken into a sequence: a <i>click</i>, some 
number of <i>drags</i>, and a <i>release</i>.  (These are abstract 
operations, and do not necessarily correspond to physical mouse 
clicks, drags, and releases.)

<p> When an interactor is first created, it can do absolutely nothing.  
To enable it to do something, the creator "binds" the interactor to an 
object or tag on the Slate.  Usually (depending on the interactor 
class), this creates a single event binding on the slate that calls the 
interactor's <b>activate</b> method when the mouse button is 
pressed on the item.

<p> When invoked by a mouse click (or some other such action), the 
<b>activate</b> method adds some more bindings to the Slate, for 
mouse motion and mouse release.  It then calls its own 
<b>click</b> method: in this method, the interactor takes whatever 
action it thinks is appropriate -- this usually involves at least 
remembering the starting coordinates of the interaction sequence, and 
forwarding those coordinates onto the interactors <i>target</i> (more 
about targets below).

<p> When the mouse is moved, the interactor's <b>drag</b> method 
is called (by the binding set up by <b>activate</b>).  
<b>drag</b> computes new coordinates, and then forwards them onto 
the target.  At the termination of the interaction sequence, the user 
releases the mouse, which causes the <b>release</b> and 
<b>deactivate</b> methods to be called.  The first performs any 
actions needed (usually, not much), while the second restores the Slate 
bindings to how they were before the interaction started.

<p> When interaction with an item or set of items is no longer needed, 
the interaction bindings can be removed with the <b>unbind</b> 
method.  There are many more complex variations on this basic sequence 
of events, and we are still discovering ways in which interaction can be 
characterized and re-used.

<p> An interactor has a "target," which is a Slate item ID, and may have 
a "proxy," which is another interactor.  If an interactor has a proxy, 
then it forwards each interaction event (click, drag, or release) to its 
proxy (after calculating and modifying coordinates.) If not, then it 
forwards the coordinates to the Slate's <b>interact</b> method, with 
a flag indicating which phase of the interaction it is in. Proxies are 
set with the <b>cascade</b> and <b>uncascade</b> methods.

<p> The behavior of interactors can be parameterized in three ways:
The first way is by supplying options to its <b>bind</b>
method. Currently, <b>bind</b> accepts these options:

<ul>

<li><b>-button <i>button</i></b>: The mouse button to react to.  By 
default, this is button 1 (the left one).

<li><b>-modifiers <i>modifiers</i></b>: A list of modifiers
needed to make the interactor respond.  The list can include any of
the following: <b>shift</b>, <b>alt</b>,
<b>meta</b>, and <b>control</b>.  The default is an empty
list.

<li><b>-ghost</b>: If present, this flag indicates that moving or 
resizing is to be performed with a "ghost" of the item.

</ul>

The second is with configuration options that are executed at certain
times in an interaction sequence:

<ul>
<li><b>-activatecommand</b>: If not null, this is a function-script 
(see the documentation for the <b>apply</b> procedure) which is 
applied to four arguments when the interactor is activated: the 
interactor, the target, and the current <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> 
coordinates. This is used to customize the behavior of the interactor
depending on information that is not known until activation.

<li><b>-deactivatecommand</b>: If not null, this is a function-script 
which is applied to the same four arguments when the interactor is 
de-activated.

<li><b>-dragcommand</b>: If not null, this is a function-script 
which is applied to the same four arguments at the completion of the
interactor's <b>drag</b> method.

</ul>

The third is with configuration options that are override the default
forwarding of interaction events (click, drag, release).  These are
typically used to implement more sophisticated model-view-controller
interfaces, in which the interaction events (from the controller) are
forward to the slate (the view) only after interception and processing
by some other object (the model). These options are

<ul> <li><b>-clickprefix</b>: If not null, this is a script which has
the target and coordinates appended and evaluated in the
<b>click</b> method. This is typically used if the mouse
interaction is not going directly to a Slate.

<li><b>-dragprefix</b>: If not null, this is a script which has the
target and coordinates appended and evaluated in the <b>drag</b>
method. This is typically used if the mouse interaction is not going
directly to a Slate.

<li><b>-releaseprefix</b>: If not null, this is a script which has the
target and coordinates appended and evaluated in the
<b>release</b> method. This is typically used if the mouse
interaction is not going directly to a Slate.

</ul>
