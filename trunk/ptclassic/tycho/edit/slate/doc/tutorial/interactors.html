<h1>Interactors</h1>

The binding mechanism described in the previous section is quite
low-level. Although just dragging an item about is simple enough,
trying to do more complicated quickly gets tricky. The Slate provides
a higher-level mechanism based on the concept of <i>interactors</i>,
as described by Brad Myers and used in the Garnet system.

 <P> In the Slate, each interactor is an object that manages a
particular set of event bindings in order to make a particular user
interaction happen. This includes moving items in various ways
(quantizing, bounds, and so on), selecting items, and editing text
items.

 <P>Let's create some items:

<tcl quiet><pre>
  package require slate.demo
  set slate [::demo::newslate "Interactor examples"]
  set rect [$slate create rectangle 60 60 100 100 -fill red]
  set frame [$slate create Frame 120 120 170 150 &#92
       -borderwidth 4 -color green -tags fred]
</pre></tcl>

 <P>
The most basic kind of interactor is the Follower, so called because
it makes items "follow" the mouse. The simplest way to create a follower
is like this:

<tcl quiet><pre>
  set follower [$slate interactor Follower]
</pre></tcl>

 <P>
To make the interactor operate on items, you "bind" them to
items or tags. For example:

<tcl quiet><pre>
  $follower bind fred -button 1
</pre></tcl>

<p>
You can now drag the frame with the mouse (but not the rectangle,
since it doesn't have the tag "fred"). The <B>-button</B> options
specifies which mouse button to respond to; you can also use
the <B>-modifiers</B> option with an argument such as
<B>shift</B> or <B>{alt control}</B> to specify key modifiers.

 <P>
To turn this off again, go:

<tcl><pre>
  $follower unbind fred -button 1
</pre></tcl>

The frame no longer responds to the mouse.
Note that the option list <B>-button 1</B> must be identical
to that passed to <B>bind</B> for unbinding to work properly.

 <P>The Slate comes with several other kinds of interactor. For
example, Bounder keeps an item within a specified
region of the slate.  Try this:

<tcl quiet><pre>
  $slate create rectangle 50 50 200 200 -outline red
  set bounder [$slate interactor Bounder -bounds {50 50 200 200}]
  $bounder bind $rect -button 1
</pre></tcl>

(Try moving the red rectangle with the mouse.) Bounder can be used
constrain movement along one axis:

<tcl quiet><pre>
  $bounder configure -constrain x
</pre></tcl>

(Try moving the red rectangle now.) 

<p>Interactors can be cascaded, to make more complex interactions. For 
example, we can create a <i>Stepper</i> interactor that quantizes 
movement to a certain size, and cascade it with the bounder:

<tcl><pre>
  set stepper [$slate interactor Stepper -stepsize 10]
  $bounder configure -constrain none
  $bounder cascade $stepper
</pre></tcl>

(Try moving the red rectangle now.)
