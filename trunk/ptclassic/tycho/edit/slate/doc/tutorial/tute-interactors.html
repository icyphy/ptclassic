<h1>Interactors</h1>

<p>The Slate supports bindings in exactly the same way as the
Tk canvas. These can be used to implement moving of items and other 
forms of interaction. The Slate also provides a higher-level 
mechanism, based on the concept of <i>interactors</i>, as described by 
Brad Myers and used in the Garnet system.

<tcl quiet><pre>
  set slate [::tycho::Slate::demoslate]
  set r [$slate create rectangle 60 20 80 40 -fill red]
  set f [$slate create Frame 120 120 150 140 &#92
       -borderwidth 4 -color green -tags fred]
</pre></tcl>

<p>Each interactor is an object that inherits from the Interactor 
class. The most basic kind of interactor is the Follower, which 
"follows" the mouse. Assuming you still have the Slate from earlier in 
this tutorial (if not, you will need to go back and re-execute
the code), you can create an interactor with the <code>interact</code> 
method:

<tcl quiet><pre>
set follower [$slate interactor Follower]
</pre></tcl>

<p>An interactor is "bound" to one or more objects with the
<CODE>bind</CODE> command. For example, this will bind the follower
you just created to the items tagged with <CODE>fred</CODE> (the
Frame):

<tcl quiet><pre>
$follower bind fred -button 1
</pre></tcl>

<p>You can now drag the frame, but not the rectangle, with the mouse!
To turn this off again, use <code>unbind</code>:

<tcl><pre>
$follower unbind fred -button 1
</pre></tcl>

<p>There are several other kinds of interactor. <i>Bounder</i> moves
an object within a specified region of the Slate. We'll create a 
rectangle so you can see the region:

<tcl quiet><pre>
$slate create rectangle 50 50 200 200 -outline red
set bounder [$slate interactor Bounder -bounds {50 50 200 200}]
$bounder bind $r -button 1
</pre></tcl>

(Try moving the red rectangle with the mouse.) If the <code>-bounds</code>
option is not given, the Bounder interactor keeps the object within the
bounds of the Slate. Bounder can be used constrain movement along
one axis:

<tcl quiet><pre>
$bounder configure -constrain x
</pre></tcl>

(Try moving the red rectangle now.) 

<p>Interactors can be cascaded, to make more complex interactions. For 
example, we can create a <i>Stepper</i> interactor that quantizes 
movement to a certain size, and cascade it with the bounder:

<tcl><pre>
set stepper [$slate interactor Stepper -stepsize 10]
$bounder configure -constrain none
$bounder cascade $stepper
</pre></tcl>

(Try moving the red rectangle now.)
