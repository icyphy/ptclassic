<h1>Creating custom widgets</h1>

<p>One of the uses of the Slate is to rapidly create custom widgets.  
We'll use the Slate and some interactors to simulate a custom widget 
that mimics a "slider" as used on audio equipment.  This example is a 
simple version of the complete <a 
href="../usersGuides/SliderHelp.html">Slider</a> widget contained in the 
Slate directory.

<p>First, make a clean slate:
<tcl quiet><pre>
set slate [::tycho::Slate::demoslate]
</pre></tcl>

<p>Now, create some items that represent the slider components. The 
first is a text item to display the current value:

<tcl quiet><pre>
set value [$slate create text 50 20 -text 0 -anchor s -fill blue]
</pre></tcl>

<p>The second is the vertical "trough" of the slider:

<tcl quiet><pre>
set trough [$slate create Frame 48 23 52 143 -color darkgrey &#92
		-borderwidth 2 -relief sunken]
</pre></tcl>

<p>The third is the horizontal "bar" of the slider:

<tcl quiet><pre>
set bar [$slate create Frame 40 132 60 142  &#92
		-color darkseagreen -borderwidth 3]
</pre></tcl>

<p>When the bar is moved, we want to update the display of the slider 
value.  Assuming the slider ranges from 0 to 11, this procedure will 
update it:

<tcl><pre>
proc updatevalue {args} {
    global slate bar value
    set position [expr [lindex [$slate coords $bar] 1] + 5]
    set x [expr (137.0-$position)/108.0 * 11.0]
    $slate itemconfigure $value -text [format %.1f $x]
}
</pre></tcl>

<p>Now, we need some interactors to move the bar.  Firstly, create and 
bind a <a href="../codeDoc/Bounder.html">Bounder</a> that moves the bar along the trough.  It is given a 
value for its <code>-bounds</code> option to prevent it being moved past 
the ends of the trough:

<tcl quiet><pre>
set bounder [$slate interactor Bounder &#92
		-dragcommand updatevalue &#92
		-constrain y -bounds {0 24 0 142}]	
$bounder bind $bar -button 1
</pre></tcl>

(Try moving the bar.) Now, suppose instead we want the bar to move in 
steps of 0.5 instead of continuously.  To do this, create a 
<a href="../codeDoc/Stepper.html">Stepper</a> 
interactor and cascade it with the
 <a href="../codeDoc/Bounder.html">Bounder</a> interactor:

<tcl quiet><pre>
set stepper [$slate interactor Stepper -stepsize [expr 108.0/22] &#92
		-dragcommand updatevalue]
$bounder cascade $stepper
</pre></tcl>

(Now try moving the bar. Depending on where the bar was when you
invoked the above code, the displayed values may not be multiples of
0.5. For this simple example, we won't worry about fixing this.) To get
back to the previous behavior, remove  the stepper from the chain:

<tcl><pre>
$bounder uncascade
</pre></tcl>

We have just used a couple of interactors that use the
mouse to manipulate graphical object -- most interactors are
in fact of this type. To illustrate that there is more
to interactors than just dragging things about with the mouse, let's
first create a label underneath the slider:

<tcl quiet><pre>
set label [$slate create text 50 150 -text "A slider" -anchor n &#92
			-justify center]
</pre></tcl>

And then attach an <a href="../codeDoc/TextItemEdit.html">TextItemEdit</a>
interactor to it:

<tcl quiet><pre>
set editor [$slate interactor TextItemEdit]
$editor bind $label
</pre></tcl>

Now, clicking on the label underneath the slider will place the
insertion cursor in the label and allow you to edit it. Use shift with
the cursor keys to select a region; use Control with the cursor keys to
move left and right a word at a time. To remove the cursor from the
label:

<tcl quiet><pre>
$editor stop
</pre></tcl>

To disable editing completely:

<tcl quiet><pre>
$editor unbind $label
</pre></tcl>

This example has created a slider directly onto a Slate. The complete
Slider widget is an [incr Tk] mega-widget, and so can be created just
like any other widget:

<tcl><pre>
::tycho::Displayer .d
::tycho::Slider .d.s -label Fred -resolution 0.5 -to 11 -command puts
pack .d.s
.d centerOnScreen
</pre></tcl>

(This Slider prints its current value to the Tcl console.
There's actually a bug in it: it is performing too many
prints...)
The Slider widget has <a href="../usersGuides/SliderHelp.html">a more
complex set of interaction mechanisms</a>, and uses two more
interactors we have not used in this tutorial:

<ul>
<li>A <i>Repeater</i> interactor steps the bar at fixed time intervals
towards the mouse while the left button is held down anywhere near the trough.
<li>Another <i>Alonger</i> is used to "jump" the bar to the mouse 
position when the middle button is clicked anywhere near the trough.
</ul>

 <P>See the <a href="../usersGuides/SliderHelp.html">Slider User's
Guide</a> for a description of its operation,  the <a
href="../codeDoc/Slider.html">Slider class documentation</a> for more
information on its calling interface and options, and the 
<a href="tute-interactors.html">Interactor overview</a> document for detailed
information on the interactors.
