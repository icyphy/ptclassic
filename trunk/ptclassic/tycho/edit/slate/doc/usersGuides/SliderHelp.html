<P>
The Slider widget displays a movable "bar" that slides along
a vertical "trough." It performs the same function  as the Tk
<i>scale</i> widget but looks more like a physical slider, so works 
better in "control panels" and similar styles of interface.

<P>At the top of the slider is a display of the current 
value. Below that is the trough and slider bar, and at the bottom a 
label. There are three ways of moving the slider bar:

<ol>
<li>Drag it with the left button. If the resolution of the slider has 
been set to a non-zero value, the bar jumps in appropriate 
increments; if not, it moves smoothly.

<li>Click with the left button anywhere near the slider trough and hold
the button down. The bar will repeatedly move one step (one resolution
increment if non-zero, else one pixel) at a time. There is a delay
between the first and second steps of about 400 ms; after, steps repeat
at about 10 times per second. The bar steps moving when it reaches the
mouse cursor.

<li>Click with the middle button anywhere near the trough. The bar
will jump to the mouse position. If the button remains held down 
while the mouse is moved, the bar follows the mouse.

</ol>
