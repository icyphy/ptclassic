<p>
This class provides a text editor specialized for editing
C files.
It is invoked automatically when opening any file with the
<a name=".c extension">".c" extension</a> 
in its name.
The <a name="EditC class">EditC class</a> is derived from the
<a href=EditProgramHelp.html>EditProgram class</a>, and
therefore inherits all of its features.
At the moment, it does little more than color comments.
