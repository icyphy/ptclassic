<h1><a name="Tcl editor">User's Guide to the Itcl Editor</a></h1>
<p>
This class provides a text editor specialized for editing
Itcl source.
It is automatically invoked whenever you open any file with an
<a name=".itcl">".itcl" extension</a> or
<a name=".itk">".itk" extension</a>.
Itcl is an object-oriented extension to the Tcl language
that was developed by Michael McLennan of AT&T Bell Labs.
(Itk is the associated extension to Tk).
The <a name="EditItcl class">EditItcl class</a> is derived from the
<a href="EditTclHelp.html">EditTcl class</a>, and
therefore inherits all of its features.
It colors certain Itcl constructs, such as comments
and class and method definitions.
<p>
This class inherits its hyperlink mechanism (the
<a name="Show Links command">"Show Links" command</a> in the "Format" menu)
from the Tcl editor.
However, because of the namespaces in Itcl, the references to
procedures and methods are only identified if
they are completely qualified.  For
example, "::tycho::EditTcl" will be identified as a link,
but "EditTclText" will not.  Unfortunately, since Itcl-2.0 is
dynamically scoped, it appears that there is no way around this.
<p>
The <a name="Evaluate command">"Evaluate" command</a> in the "File" menu
evaluates the Itcl code in the selection (if there is a selection) or
the entire file (if there is no selection).  The returned result
is displayed.
In the case where the entire file is evaluated,
the editor first deletes any
classes that are defined within the file so that it can safely redefine
these classes.  As a side effect, all instances of the classes and
all derived classes will also be deleted.
If these derived classes are not accessible by auto-loading,
then they must be manually reloaded.
Note that the Itcl auto-loading mechanism
implies some formatting restrictions on the syntax.
Specifically, class definitions must appear with the keyword "class"
starting in column zero and the class name following it on the same
line.
Moreover, the deletion of classes will only work properly if the class
names are fully qualified with all namespaces (the class names should
begin with "::").  If this is not the case, then there is no way to tell
from the syntax of the file what classes are actually being defined
(it depends on what namespace the file is evaluated in).
If the class name is not fully specified, we assume it is defined
in the global namespace only.
<p>

The <A NAME="Itcl Editor Body Template">"Body Template" command</A> in
the "Special" menu places a body template at the current point in the buffer.
An example body template would be:
<LISTING>
#####################################################################
#### myMethod 
#
# body::tycho::ClassName::myMethod {} {

}
</LISTING>
<P>
The <A NAME="Itcl Editor File Template">"File Template" command</A> in
the "Special" menu copies the file <A
HREF="../../../../doc/coding/template.itcl"><CODE>$TYCHO/doc/coding/template.itcl</CODE></A>
into the editor and substitutes in a class name based on the file
name.  For example, if the file is named <CODE>Elvis.itcl</CODE>, then
the class name <CODE>Elvis</CODE> will be substituted in.
 <P>

The <A NAME="Itcl Editor Generate doc">"Generate doc" command</A> in
the "Special" menu asks the user if they would like to save the buffer
and then runs the <A
HREF="../../../../lib/tydoc/doc/introduction.html">Tydoc</A> itcl to
HTML converter on the file and displays the results.  Tydoc produces a
HTML file at
<CODE>doc/codeDoc/</CODE><I>clasName</I><CODE>.html</CODE>.  The
<CODE>index.html</CODE> file in <CODE>doc/codeDoc</CODE> is not
updated by "Generate doc", since we are only passing one file to the
Tydoc system.  To update <CODE>index.html</CODE>, usually one runs
<CODE>make itcldocs</CODE>.
