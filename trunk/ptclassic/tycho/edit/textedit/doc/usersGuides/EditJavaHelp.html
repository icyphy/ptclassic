This class provides a text editor specialized for editing Java source.
It is automatically invoked whenever you open any file with a
<A NAME=".java">".java" extension</A>.
Java is an object-oriented language developed by Sun.  Java is similar
to C++, but Java has a few new features, such as garbage collection. Java
also is missing a few features C++ has, such as multiple inheritance.
<!-- If you don't know what java is, then you have probably been in solitary
confinement :-) -->
 <P>
The <a name="EditJava class">EditJava class</a> is derived from the
<a href="EditCppHelp.html">EditCpp class</a>, and
therefore inherits all of its features, such as invoking <CODE>make</CODE>.
The EditJava class colors certain Java constructs, such as comments.
 <P>
The <CODE>appletview</CODE> choice in the <CODE>Special</CODE> menu
brings up the <CODE>appletviewer</CODE> program and loads the file being
edited into <CODE>appletviewer</CODE>
