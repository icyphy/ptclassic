<h1><a name="makefile editor">User's Guide to the Makefile Editor</a></h1>
<p>
This class provides a text editor specialized for editing
makefiles.
It is invoked automatically when opening any file with the
name "makefile", "Makefile", or any file with the
<a name=".mk extension">".mk" extension</a> in its name.
The <a name="EditMake class">EditMake class</a> is derived from the
<a href=EditProgramHelp.html>EditProgram class</a>, and
therefore inherits all of its features.
It provides additional features
for editing Makefile source code.
It colors variables, referenced variables, includes, and rules.
It disables the indenting features of the base class, so
tabs are inserted by using the Tab key, as normal.
