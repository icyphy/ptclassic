<p>
This class provides a text editor specialized for editing
source code.  It includes generic features that are useful in
a variety of languages, and therefore serves as a base class for
language-specific editors.
The <a name="EditProgram class">EditProgram class</a> is derived from the
<a href="../../../../kernel/gui/doc/usersGuides/EditHelp.html">Edit class</a>, and
therefore inherits all of its features.
<p>
The editor automatically indents a line in response to a <CODE>Tab</CODE>
character, and
provides a command for indenting a region (the selection).  To enter a
<a name="tab">literal <CODE>Tab</CODE></a>,
enter the sequence <CODE>C-tab</CODE> (<CODE>Control-Tab</CODE>).
<p>
The editor also colors comments and the strings
<CODE>FIXME</CODE> and <CODE>NOTE</CODE>, and provides a
method for commenting out a region. 
It supports only line-oriented
comments (where a comment line is preceded by a specified comment
string), although some derived classes generalize this to other comment
styles.
The <a name="recolorize"><CODE>Recolorize</CODE></a>
command in the <CODE>Format</CODE>
menu will update the colors after you have edited a file,
and a <CODE>Tab</CODE> character will recolorize (and indent) the current line.
<p>
The <a name="Fill Region command"><CODE>fill region</CODE></a>
command in the <CODE>Format</CODE>
menu will fill the set of lines identified by the selection so that they
are roughly the same length. It puts the comment prefix on each line, and
colors the region with the comment color.
The comment prefix can be set with the
<a name="Set Fill Prefix command"><CODE>Set Fill Prefix</CODE> command</a>
in the <CODE>Format</CODE>menu.
It will invoke a dialog that allows you to set or change the prefix
used to mark comments.
The width of the fill region can be set with the
<a name="Right Fill Column command"><CODE>Right Fill Column</CODE> command</a>
in the <CODE>Format</CODE> menu.
It will invoke a dialog that allows you to set or change the maximum
length of each line (which defaults to 70 characters).
<p>
Finally, the editor matches <a name="parentheses">parentheses</a>,
brackets, and curly braces.
When you enter a close parenthesis, the editor determines whether
the corresponding open parenthesis is visible, and if it is,
highlights the text between the open parenthesis and the close
parenthesis.
