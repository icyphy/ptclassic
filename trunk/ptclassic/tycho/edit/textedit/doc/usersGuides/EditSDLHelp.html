<h1><a name="SDL editor">User's Guide to the SDL Editor</a></h1>

This class provides a text editor specialized for editing System
Description Language (SDL) files. The editor is automatically invoked
whenever the <CODE>.sdl</CODE> extension appended to its name.  The
<code>EditSDL</code> class, which implements the editor, is derived
from the <a href="EditProgramHelp.html"><code>EditProgram</code>
class</a>, and therefore inherits all of its features. Its facility
for tagging comments, strings, and keywords is inherited from this
base class.

describes SDL: 

<blockquote>
SDL is a Specification and Description Language standardized by ITU
(International Telecommunication Union). The language has been evolving
since the first recommendation in 1980, 1984, 1988 and 1992 when Object
Oriented features were included in the language. SDL is widely used in
the telecommunications field. 

<p>SDL is not directed specifically at describing telecommunications
services, but it is a general purpose description language for
communication systems. The basis for description of behaviour is
communicating Extended State Machines that are represented by
processes. Communication is represented by signals and can take place
between processes or between processes and the environment of the
system model. Some aspects of communication between processes are
closely related to the description of system structure. An Extended
State Machine consists of a number of states and a number of
transitions connecting the states. One of the states is designated the
initial state.
