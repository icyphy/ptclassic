<h1><a name="Itcl Class List editor">User's Guide to the Itcl Class
List Editor</a></h1>

This class provides a text editor specialized for editing lists of
Itcl classes.  These class lists can be used to generate an 
<A HREF="../../../../doc/tychoClasses.dag">graphical class diagram</A>.

This tool is automatically invoked whenever you open any file with a
<A NAME=".icl">".icl"</A> extension (.icl stands for Itcl Class List).

The <A NAME="ItclClassList">ItclClassList class</A> is derived from 
the <A HREF="../../../../kernel/doc/usersGuides/EditHelp.html">Edit class</A>,
and therefore inherits all of its features.

 <P>The Itcl Class List tool consists of a tool bar and a windowpane
containing the current list of itcl classes.  Usually, the user adds
classes to the list and then generates a class diagram.

<H2>Toolbar</H2>
The tool bar consists of the following buttons:
<DL>

<DT> Include Tycho

<DD> This button inserts the names of all of the Tycho Itcl files into
the current list.  This is especially useful if you want to make a
custom diagram of the Tycho classes and classes the you are working on.

<DT> Include Directory

<DD> This button brings up a file browser and prompts the user to
select a file in a directory.  All of the <CODE>*.itcl</CODE> and
<CODE>*.itk</CODE> files are then added to the current list of Itcl
files.

<DT> Clear
<DD> This button clears the entire contents of the current list.

<DT> Diagram File Name

<DD> This button brings up a file browser that allows the you to
select the file name of class diagram to be produced.  The class
diagram that is produced is a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), so the 
diagram file name should have a <CODE>.dag</CODE> extension.

<DT> Update Class Diagram

<DD> This button generates a class diagram from the current list of
files.  The class diagram is a DAG, so the <A
HREF="../../../visedit/doc/usersGuides/EditDAGHelp.html">EditDAG
class</A> is used.

</DL>

<H2>Bugs</H2>
<MENU>

<LI> Because we use a Directed Acyclic Graph to display the class hierarchy,
multiple inheritance is not shown.  If a class has multiple inheritance,
then we bring up a message.

<LI> Since Itcl is dynamically scoped, it can be difficult to determine
inheritance from just reading a file.  In particular, subtle
differences in namespaces can confuse this tool.  For example, the <A
HREF="../../../../kernel/TWidget.itcl"><CODE>TWidget</CODE></A> class
inherits from <CODE>::itk::Widget</CODE> with the following:
<PRE>
class ::tycho::TWidget {
    inherit ::itk::Widget
</PRE>
However, in Itcl2.2, the Widget class is specified with:
<PRE>
class itk::Widget {
    inherit itk::Archetype
</PRE>

At this point, the class diagram tool will not match up
<CODE>::itk::Widget</CODE> and <CODE>itk::Widget</CODE>.  In theory,
the code could be modified so that it prepends <CODE>::</CODE>
if necessary.

<LI> It would be nice if the 'Include Directory' button had a preference
that determined what extensions were globbed for and included. 

<LI> There should be a way for the user to specify the label of the
DAG from within the tool.  Currently, the workaround is to edit the file
by hand.
