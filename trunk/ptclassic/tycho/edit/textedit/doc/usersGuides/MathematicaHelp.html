<h1>User's Guide to the Mathematica Shell</h1>
<p>
The Mathematica class in Tycho provides a shell for interacting with
Mathematica.  Currently, this only works if Tycho is running with Ptolemy
(see <a href="../../../../doc/running.html">Running Tycho</a>),
and Ptolemy has been compiled to work with Mathematica.
The Mathematica class is derived from the
<a href="../../../../kernel/gui/doc/usersGuides/TclShellHelp.html">TclShell class</a>,
and therefore inherits all of its features.
In particular, the mechanisms for scrolling through and editing
command histories are fully supported.
In addition, Mathematica data can be accessed from Tcl or Ptolemy
using ptcl commands.  See the ptcl documentation.
