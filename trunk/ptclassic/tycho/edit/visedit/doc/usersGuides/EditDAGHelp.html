<h1><a name="directed acyclic graph (DAG) editor">User's Guide to the Directed Acyclic Graph Editor</a></h1>
This class provides a graphical editor specialized for editing
a directed acyclic graph (DAG).
It is automatically invoked whenever you open any file with a
<A NAME=".dag">".dag" extension</A>.
A DAG is a Graph that does not have cycles.  Support for DAGs is built
into the kernel in the <A
HREF="../../../../kernel/doc/codeDoc/DirectedAcyclicGraph.html"><CODE>DirectedAcyclicGraph</CODE></A>
class.
<A NAME="EditDAG class">EditDAG class</A> is derived from the 
<A HREF="GraphicsHelp.html">Graphics class</A>, and therefore
inherits all of its features.
<P>

Nodes in the canvas widget can be mouse sensitive.  For an example of 
DAG, see <A HREF="../../../../doc/tychoClasses.dag">$TYCHO/doc/tychoClasses.dag</A>
