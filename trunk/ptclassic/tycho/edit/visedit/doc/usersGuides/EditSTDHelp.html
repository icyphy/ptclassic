<h1><a name="state transition diagram editor">User's Guide to the
State Transition Diagram Editor</a></h1>

The finite state machine (FSM) has been one of the most popular models
for describing control-oriented systems, like real-time process
controllers. A directed node-and-arc graph, called a state transition
diagram (STD), can be used to describe an FSM. It represents a system
in the form of states (nodes) and transitions (arcs) between states.

 <P>The State Transition Diagram editor is automatically invoked
whenever you open any file with a 
<a name=".std"><CODE>.std</CODE> extension</a>.

The <a name="EditSTD class">EditSTD class</a> is derived from the
<a href="EditBubbleAndArcHelp.html">EditBubbleAndArc class</a>, and
therefore inherits all of its features.

 <P>Currently, the STD Editor is not very useful without Ptolemy, we include  
the documentation within Tycho only for the sake of uniformity.

<H2>How to use the STD Editor</H2>

<H3>Edit a new STD file</H3>

To edit a new STD for an FSM either open a file with the file
extension <CODE>.std</CODE> , or drag down the <CODE>Window</CODE> menu and
under <CODE>Graphical Editors</CODE>choose <CODE>State transition diagram
editor</CODE>.  A message window will pop up to ask for machine type. So
far there is only one type of FSM supported, called mixed Mealy/Moore
machine.

<H3>Edit the Input/Output and Internal Events Names</H3>

If there are any input/output and internal events for the FSM, their
names must be specified: Drag down the <CODE>Special</CODE> menu and choose
<CODE>I/O Port Names...</CODE>, then enter the names for the
input/output. Each name should be separated by at least one space.

<H3>Draw/Edit a State</H3>

To draw a state, either drag down the <CODE>Edit</CODE> menu and
choose <CODE>New Node</CODE>, or use the keyboard accelerator
<CODE>N</CODE>. Then a crossbar cursor will appear in the
window. Press and hold (don't release) the left mouse button, and move
the mouse to get a different shape of node. Release the button to
finish the drawing.

 <P> To edit a state, first select the state by pressing the left
mouse button on it. Then either drag down the <CODE>Edit</CODE> menu
and choose <CODE>Edit Item</CODE>, or use the <CODE>e</CODE> keyboard accelerator key.

<H3> Draw/Edit a Transition</H3>

To draw a transition, either drag down the <CODE>Edit</CODE> menu and
choose <CODE>New Arc</CODE>, or use the <CODE>A</CODE> keyboard
accelerator key. Then a crossbar cursor will appear in the
window. Press the left mouse button on the periphery of the starting
state.  Move the mouse and press the left mouse button to get more
delicate arc.  To finish the drawing, move the mouse on the periphery
of the ending state and press the left mouse button.

 <P>To edit a transition, first select the transition by pressing the
left mouse button on it. Then either drag down the <CODE>Edit</CODE> menu
and choose <CODE>Edit Item</CODE>, or use the <CODE>e</CODE> keyboard
accelerator key.

<H3>Delete a State/Transition</H3>

First select the state/transition by pressing the left mouse button on
it, then drag down the <CODE>Edit</CODE> menu and choose <CODE>Delete</CODE>.

<H3>Move/Reshape a State/Transition</H3>

To move a state, press and hold the left mouse button on it, then move
the mouse to the desired position. To reshape a state, first select
the state, and move the cursor to the up/down/left/right periphery of
the state to get an up/down/left/right arrow-shape cursor, then press
and hold the left mouse button and move the mouse to reshape it.

<P>To move/reshape a transition, first select it, then some small
rectangles will appear along the arc. Press and move one of the
rectangles to move/reshape the arc.

<H2>Working in Ptolemy</H2>

 <P>From the point of view of implementation, a stand-alone FSM domain in
Ptolemy is not very interesting, because in most of applications, in
addition to the control part, they contains many other parts, such as
signal processing. Moreover, there are various Ptolemy domains. With
the FSM domain mixed with them, we can get a much more powerful FSM
model.

<H3>Make an Icon in <CODE>vem</CODE></H3>

Unlike other domains, an FSM galaxy is edited within the Tycho STD
Editor instead of within <CODE>vem</CODE>. However, to work with other
domains, an icon in <CODE>vem</CODE> is required to represent the
corresponding FSM galaxy described in an STD file. 
<OL>

<LI> In Ptolemy, Tycho can be started by typing a <CODE>y</CODE> while
the mouse is over a facet.

<LI> To make an icon in <CODE>vem</CODE> for the STD file,
first open the file from within the Tycho window started from within Ptolemy.

<LI> Then drag down the <CODE>Special</CODE> menu and choose
<CODE>Make Icon...</CODE>

<LI> This will load the FSM galaxy into the Ptolemy kernel,
and make an icon with appropriate input/output ports in the specified
palette in <CODE>vem</CODE>.
</OL>


 <P>The icon looks like a star (blue outline), but it is actually an
galaxy. This may be confusing, but the reason is to avoid using a
Octtools handle, which would require adding Octtools knowledge to
Tycho.

 <P> There are two different ways to make an icon in <CODE>vem</CODE>:
<CODE>ptkSetMkSchemIcon</CODE> and <CODE>ptkSetMkStar</CODE>. The
former one needs an <CODE>OctFactHandle</CODE> as one argument and is
used for other <CODE>vem</CODE> galaxy. The FSM galaxy uses Tycho as
the editor instead of <CODE>vem</CODE>, so there is no OctFactHandle
for an FSM galaxy. Therefore the latter one, which uses the star (or
galaxy) name instead, is more appropriate for this case.

 <P>If the mouse is over a FSM galaxy icon inside vem and the
<CODE>i</CODE> key is pressed, then Tycho will automatically display
the corresponding STD file inside a STD editor.

(Note: if the environment variable
<CODE>PT_DISPLAY</CODE> is set to other editor instead of Tycho, it
must be unset for the look-inside to work).
