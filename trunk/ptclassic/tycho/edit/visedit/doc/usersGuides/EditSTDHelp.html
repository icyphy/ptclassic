State Transition Diagram Editor</a></h1>

The finite state machine (FSM) has been one of the most popular models
for describing control-oriented systems, like real-time process
controllers. A directed node-and-arc graph, called a state transition
diagram (STD), can be used to describe an FSM. It represents a system
in the form of states (nodes) and transitions (arcs) between states.

 <P>The State Transition Diagram editor is automatically invoked
whenever you open any file with a <a name=".std">".std" extension</a>.

The <a name="EditSTD class">EditSTD class</a> is derived from the
<a href="EditBubbleAndArcHelp.html">EditBubbleAndArc class</a>, and
therefore inherits all of its features.

Note that STDs are not part of Ptolemy0.6, but should be available in
the next Ptolemy release.

<H2>How to use the STD Editor</H2>

<H3>Edit a new STD file</H3>

To edit a new STD for an FSM either open a file with the file
extension <CODE>.std</CODE> , or drag down the <I>Window</I> menu and
under <I>Graphical Editors</I>choose <I>State transition diagram
editor</I>.  A message window will pop up to ask for machine type. So
far there is only one type of FSM supported, called mixed Mealy/Moore
machine.

<H3>Edit the Input/Output and Internal Events Names</H3>

If there are any input/output and internal events for the FSM, their
names must be specified: Drag down the <I>Special</I> menu and choose
<I>I/O Port Names...</I>, then enter the names for the
input/output. Each name should be separated by at least one space.

<H3>Draw/Edit a State</H3>

To draw a state, either drag down the <I>Edit</I> menu and choose
<I>New Node</I>, or press the hot key <CODE>Shift-N</CODE>.  . Then a
crossbar cursor will appear in the window. Press and hold (don't
release) the left mouse button, and move the mouse to get a different
shape of node. Release the button to finish the drawing.

 <P> To edit a state, first select the state by pressing the left
mouse button on it. Then either drag down the <I>Edit</I> menu and
choose <I>Edit Item</I>, or press the hot key <CODE>e</CODE>.

<H3> Draw/Edit a Transition</H3>

To draw a transition, either drag down the <I>Edit</I> menu and choose
<I>New Arc</I>, or press the hot key <CODE>Shift-A</CODE>. Then a
crossbar cursor will appear in the window. Press the left mouse button
on the periphery of the starting state.  Move the mouse and press the
left mouse button to get more delicate arc.  To finish the drawing,
move the mouse on the periphery of the ending state and press the left
mouse button.

 <P>To edit a transition, first select the transition by pressing the
left mouse button on it. Then either drag down the <I>Edit</I> menu
and choose <I>Edit Item</I>, or press the hot key <CODE>e</CODE>.

<H3>Delete a State/Transition</H3>

First select the state/transition by pressing the left mouse button on
it, then drag down the <I>Edit</I> menu and choose <I>Delete</I>.

<H3>Move/Reshape a State/Transition</H3>

To move a state, press and hold the left mouse button on it, then move
the mouse to the desired position. To reshape a state, first select
the state, and move the cursor to the up/down/left/right periphery of
the state to get an up/down/left/right arrow-shape cursor, then press
and hold the left mouse button and move the mouse to reshape it.

<P>To move/reshape a transition, first select it, then some small
rectangles will appear along the arc. Press and move one of the
rectangles to move/reshape the arc.

<H2>Working in Ptolemy</H2>
<B>Note that Ptolemy0.6 does not support STDs</B>

 <P>From the point of view of implementation, a stand-alone FSM domain in
Ptolemy is not very interesting, because in most of applications, in
addition to the control part, they contains many other parts, such as
signal processing. Moreover, there are various Ptolemy domains. With
the FSM domain mixed with them, we can get a much more powerful FSM
model.

<H3>Make an Icon in VEM</H3>

Unlike other domains, an FSM galaxy is edited in a previous mentioned
STD file using Tycho instead of VEM. However, to work with other
domains, an icon in VEM is required to represent the corresponding FSM
galaxy described in an STD file. In Ptolemy, the Tycho can be started
by pressing key <CODE>Y</CODE>. To make an icon in VEM for the STD
file, first open the file in term of Tycho started in Ptolemy. Then
drag down the <I>Special</I> menu and choose <I>Make Icon...</I>. This
will load the FSM galaxy into the Ptolemy kernel, and make an icon
with appropriate input/output ports in the specified palette in VEM.

The icon looks like a star (blue outline), but it is actually an
galaxy. It may cause confusion, but the reason is to avoid using
octool handle. There are two different ways to make an icon in VEM:
ptkSetMkSchemIcon and ptkSetMkStar. The former one needs an
OctFactHandle as one argument and is used for other VEM galaxy. The
FSM galaxy uses Tycho as the editor instead of VEM, so there is no
OctFactHandle for an FSM galaxy. Therefore the latter one, which uses
the star (or galaxy) name instead, is more appropriate for this case.

Similar to the galaxy icon in other domain, when the key
<CODE>I</CODE> is pressed on the icon to look inside the galaxy, the
corresponding STD file which describes the FSM galaxy will be
automatically invoked in Tycho. (Note: if the environment variable
<CODE>PT_DISPLAY</CODE>
 is set to other editor instead of Tycho, it must be unset for the
look-inside to work.)
