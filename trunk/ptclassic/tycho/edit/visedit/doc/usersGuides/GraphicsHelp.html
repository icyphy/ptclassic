<p>

The Tycho graphics editor is still in a preliminary form.
It is currently used as a base class for more specialized editors
like the graph display widgets.  The features it currently provides
are described below.
<h3>Titles</h3>
<p>

Support for title, subtitle, author, version and copyright header
information. The idea here is to provide a common look for titles
across a wide variety of graphical display and edit widgets in Tycho
that will need titles. The <CODE>Title</CODE> command in the
<CODE>Edit</CODE> menu invokes a
dialog that facilitates entering such titles. This dialog lists only
title types that do not already exist. To edit an existing title type,
use the <CODE>Edit Item</CODE> command in the <CODE>Edit</CODE> menu.

<p>
	What goes in the version title depends on the version control
	system you will use.  If you use SCCS, then the following
	will work well:
	<pre>
	Version: &#37;W&#37; &#37;G&#37;
	</pre>
	The SCCS system will translate this when the file is checked in
	to, for example,
	<pre>
	Version: @(#)filename	1.2  12/13/96
	</pre>
	Similarly, the copyright line used at Berkeley looks like this:
	<pre>
	Copyright (c) 1995-&#37;Q&#37;, The Regents of the University of California.
	</pre>
	The SCCS version control system translates this to
	<pre>
	Copyright (c) 1995-1996, The Regents of the University of California.
	</pre>

<h3><a name="printing graphics">Printing</a></h3>
<p>
The contents of the canvas in a graphical widget can be converted
to <a name="postscript">postscript</a> and sent to a printer.  The
<CODE>Print</CODE> command in the <CODE>File</CODE> menu opens a
dialog box that controls various parameters of this process.

<h3><a name="exporting graphics">Exporting</a></h3>
<p>
The contents of the canvas in a graphical widget can be converted
to a number of file formats, including
<a name="encapsulated postscript">encapsulated postscript</a>
<a name="GIF files">GIF</a>, and
<a name="XWD files">XWD</a>.
Currently, the latter two work on Unix installations only.
The <CODE>Export</CODE> command in the <CODE>File</CODE> menu opens a
dialog box that controls various parameters of this process.
