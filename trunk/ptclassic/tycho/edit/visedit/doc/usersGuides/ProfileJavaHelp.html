<p>
This class provides a visual editor specialized for viewing the
output from <CODE>java -prof</CODE>
This profiler is derived from the
<a href="EditForestHelp.html">EditForest class</a> and
therefore inherits all of its features.
This profiler differs from the Tcl Profiler in that this profiler can
only be used to view the output from <CODE>java -prof</CODE>, there
is no way to generate a new Java profile from within this profiler.
