<h1><a name="profile tcl tool">User's Guide to the Profile Tcl Tool</a></h1>
<p>
This class provides a visual editor specialized for profiling
the execution of tcl and tcl code.
The profiler is derived from the
<a href=EditForestHelp.html>EditForest class</a>, and
therefore inherits all of its features.
<p>
The <A HREF="../../../../doc/coding/index.html">Tycho Programmer's Manual</A>
includes a section on <A HREF="../../../../doc/coding/performance.html">Performance in Tcl</A>.
<p>
The profiler consists of the usual tycho menu bar with a few buttons,
a graphical forest editor, a few counters and a the tycho status bar.
We describe each in turn.

<HR>
<H3>Profiler Buttons</H3>

<MENU>

<LI> <CODE>Start Profiling</CODE> - This button calls the TclX
<CODE>profile on</CODE> command.  To profile the execution of your
code, hit the <CODE>Start Profiling</CODE> button, execute your code,
and hit the <CODE>Display Profile</CODE> button.

<LI> <CODE>Display Profile</CODE> - This button stops the TclX profiler
and processes the profiler output.  For large runs, the processing of the
data could take a moment, tcl is traversing large arrays.

<LI> <CODE>Cancel Profile</CODE> - This button stops the TclX
profiler, but does not display the output.

</MENU>

<HR>
<H3>Profiler Grapher</H3>

The central area of the Profiler is a <a
href=EditForestHelp.html>Forest editor</a>.  After generating a
profile, the user can follow the execution of the tcl code by clicking
on nodes in the graph.  As the mouse moves over nodes in the graph,
the counters at the bottom of the screen display statistics about that
node.

<HR>
<H3>Profiler Counters</H3>

At the bottom of the Profiler are a series of counters.  These
counters display statistics about the forest node that the mouse last
passed over.  As the mouse moves over a counter, the status window
displays a short description about that counter.
