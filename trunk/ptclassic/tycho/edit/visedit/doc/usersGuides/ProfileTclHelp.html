<h1><a name="profile tcl tool">User's Guide to the Profile Tcl Tool</a></h1>
<p>
This class provides a visual editor specialized for profiling
the execution of tcl and tcl code.
The profiler is derived from the
<a href="EditForestHelp.html">EditForest class</a> and
therefore inherits all of its features.
<p>
The <A HREF="../../../../doc/coding/index.html">Tycho Programmer's Manual</A>
includes a section on <A HREF="../../../../doc/coding/performance.html">Performance in Tcl</A>.

<H2><A NAME="tclX profile command">TclX profile command</A></H2>

The Profile Tcl tool uses the TclX <CODE>profile</CODE> command.  TclX
is an extension to Tcl.  The TclX sources are available at <A
HREF="ftp://ftp.neosoft.com/pub/tcl/tclx-distrib"><CODE>ftp://ftp.neosoft.com/pub/tcl/tclx-distrib</CODE></A>.
To use the Profile Tcl tool, you must have the TclX <CODE>profile</CODE>
command available at runtime.

 <P>When the Profiler is started, the Tycho <A
HREF="../../../../kernel/doc/usersGuides/LoaderHelp.html">Loader</A>
will look for the TclX shared library that contains the
<CODE>profile</CODE> command and attempt to load it.

 <P>To use the Profiler, you must have the <CODE>profile</CODE> command.
There are several different scenarios. Pick the scenario that fits
your situation best and follow the instructions below.

 <P>The <CODE>profile</CODE> command shipped with TclX7.6.0 has
a bug that causes coredumps if used with Itcl.
The file <A
HREF="tclXprofile.c.patch"><CODE>tclXprofile.c.patch</CODE></A> is a
patch to <CODE>tclX7.6.0/tcl/generic/tclXprofile.c</CODE> that
fixes the bug.  
	
<H3><A NAME="profile command, TclX patch">2. Patch the TclX profile command and Reinstall TclX</A>
</H3>

 <P>To install this patch, you will need Larry Wall's
<CODE>patch</CODE> program.  (You can get <CODE>patch</CODE> from <A
HREF="ftp://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/pub/gnu/src/patch-2.1.tar.gz"><CODE>ftp://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/pub/gnu/src/patch-2.1.tar.gz</CODE></A>).
To install the patch
<OL>
<LI> Grab the TclX sources from
<A

<LI> <CODE>cd </CODE>to

<LI> Patch <CODE>tclXprofile.c</CODE> <CODE>patch &lt;

<LI> Install TclX by following the TclX instructions.

</OL>

<H3><A NAME="profile command, standalone version">3. Compile a standalone profile command</A>
</H3>

The directory <CODE>$TYCHO/src/profile</CODE> contains a standalone
version of <CODE>tclXprofile.c</CODE> that can be configured and
compiled to produce a shared object that can be loaded into Tycho
when profiling starts.  The Tycho Loader facility will bring up a file
browser if TclX cannot be found, and you can enter the pathname of the
<CODE>tclXprofile</CODE> object.
 <P>
 <P>To configure and build the profiler, do the following:
<PRE>
cd $TYCHO
make tclexts
</PRE>
See the <A HREF="../../../../doc/coding/buildtclexts.html">Building Tcl Extensions</A>
documentation for further information.

The <CODE>tclXprofile</CODE> shared object will be in
<CODE>$TYCHO/obj.$PTARCH</CODE>.  Under Solaris, the file will
be named <CODE>tclXprofile.so</CODE>.

<H3>The <CODE>profile</CODE> command</H3>
Below is the TclX manual page description of the <CODE>profile</CODE>
command

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<CODE>profile ?-commands? ?-eval? on</CODE>
 <P>
<CODE>profile off <I>arrayVar</I></CODE>
 <P>
This command is used to collect a performance profile of a Tcl script.  It
collects data at the Tcl procedure level. The number of calls to a procedure,
and the amount of real and CPU time is collected. Time is also collected for
the global context.  The procedure data is collected by bucketing it based on
the procedure call stack, this allows determination of how much time is spent
in a particular procedure in each of it's calling contexts.
.sp
The <CODE>-on</CODE> option enables profile data collection.
If the <CODE>-commands</CODE>
option is specified, data on all commands within a procedure is collected
as well a procedures.  Multiple occurrences of a command within a procedure
are not distinguished, but this data may still be useful for analysis.
 <P>

The <CODE>off</CODE> option turns off profiling and moves the data
collected to the array <CODE><I>arrayVar</I></CODE>.  The array is
address by a list containing the procedure call stack.  Element zero
is the top of the stack, the procedure that the data is for.  The data
in each entry is a list consisting of the procedure call count and the
real time and CPU time in milliseconds spent in the procedure (but not
any procedures it calls). The list is in the form <CODE>{<I>count real
cpu</I>}</CODE>.
 <P>
Normally, the variable scope stack is used in reporting where time is
spent.
Thus upleveled code is reported in the context that it was executed in, not
the context that the uplevel was called in.
If the <CODE>-eval</CODE> option is specified, the procedure evaluation (call) stack
is used instead of the procedure scope stack.  Upleveled code is reported in
the context of the procedure that did the uplevel.
[...]
 <P>On <B>Windows 95/NT</B>, profile command only reports elasped real time,
CPU time is not available and is reported as zero.

<H2>Profiler Description</H2>

<p>
The profiler consists of the usual tycho menu bar with a few buttons,
a graphical forest editor, a few counters and a the tycho status bar.
We describe each in turn.

<HR>
<H3>Profiler Buttons</H3>

<DL>
<DT> <CODE>Start Profiling</CODE>
<DD> This button calls the TclX <CODE>profile on</CODE> command.  To
profile the execution of your code, hit the <CODE>Start
Profiling</CODE> button, execute your code, and hit the <CODE>Display
Profile</CODE> button.

<DT> <CODE>Display Profile</CODE>
<DD> This button stops the TclX profiler and processes the profiler
output.  For large runs, the processing of the data could take a
moment, tcl is traversing large arrays.

<DT> <CODE>Cancel Profile</CODE>
<DD> This button stops the TclX profiler, but does not display the output.

</DL>

<HR>
<H3>Profiler Grapher</H3>

The central area of the Profiler is a <a
href="EditForestHelp.html">Forest editor</a>.  After generating a
profile, the user can follow the execution of the tcl code by clicking
on nodes in the graph.  As the mouse moves over nodes in the graph,
the counters at the bottom of the screen display statistics about that
node.

<HR>
<H3>Profiler Counters</H3>

At the bottom of the Profiler are a series of counters.  These
counters display statistics about the forest node that the mouse last
passed over.  As the mouse moves over a counter, the status window
displays a short description about that counter.
