# A number of windows will be created, and then some time after, destroyed.
# You should just watch.  Do not push any buttons, or you could trigger
# spurious errors.  If no errors occur during the test, there will be no
# windows left at the end.  Currently, windows are left open for 4 seconds.
# Run from within tycho (can just source this file and execute it).

# Make sure that the required packages are loaded
package require tycho.util.tytest
package require tycho.edit.visedit
