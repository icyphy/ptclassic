<h1>Fourier Series Approximation to a Square Wave</h1>

The plot below shows a sequence of approximations to a square wave constructed 
by adding together sinusoids. It is implemented by a Java class derived from PlotApplet 
that computes the data to be plotted on the fly. This is an example of a customized 
application of the ptolemy plot package, where the package is used to define base 
classes rather than as the end classes for applets or applications. 
<p>
<applet name="Fourier" code="ptolemy.plot.demo.PlotFourierSeries"
    width=500 height=300
    codebase="../../.."
    archive="ptolemy/plot/plotapplet.jar"
    alt="If you had a java-enabled browser, you would see an applet here."

</applet>
<p> Note that you can zoom in on any region of the graph by drawing a box. Start 
  at the upper left corner of the region you wish to view in more detail, and 
  drag downwards and to the right. Dragging upwards instead allows you to zoom 
  out. When zooming out, a reference box is drawn that will represent the current 
  view, and dragging will cause a box to be displayed that represents the new 
  view. Zooming out will only go as far as the original scale. Clicking on the 
  "fill" button at the upper right brings all data within range. These capabilities 
  are available in all classes in the package.
<p> The <a href="PlotFourierSeries.java">source code</a> defines a class <code>PlotFourierSeries</code> 
  derived from <code>PlotApplet</code>. This class contains a sequence of Java 
  statements in its <code>init()</code> method that configures and constructs 
  the plot. This particular example also demonstrates a number of features. In 
  particular, no marks are made at all for each plotted point, so the plot consists 
  entirely of connected lines. The X and Y ranges and tick marks are not given, 
  so they get computed automatically to just fit the data.
