<h1>Live, Animated Plot</h1>

The following plot illustrates a dynamically updated plot:
<p>
<applet name="Live" code="ptolemy.plot.demo.PlotLiveDemoApplet" width=400 height=400
    codebase="../../.."
    archive="ptolemy/plot/plotapplet.jar"
    alt="If you had a java-enabled browser, you would see an applet here."
>
<param name="background" value="faf0e6">
   <hr>If your browser recognized the applet tag,
    you would see an applet here.<hr>
</applet>
<p>
Click on the stop button to stop the plotting.
The animation on this plot has been slowed down for visual
aesthetics.
On a reasonable computer, plotting is quite fast.
<p>
Such a plot is created by defining a class derived from
<a href="../../../doc/codeDoc/ptolemy/plot/PlotLive.html">
PlotLive</a>
(which is abstract).  The example shown here is the
<a href="PlotLiveDemo.java">PlotLiveDemo</a> class.
It defines two methods, init() and addPoints().
The init() method sets static properties of the plot
(title, labels, etc.)
while the addPoints() method is called 
repeatedly from the body
of the run() method in the parent class.
<p>

There are still some problems with PlotLive.  The most
annoying is that this class uses the "exclusive or" drawing mode to
allow it to easily erase old points as it adds new ones.  This mode,
however, introduces a number of artifacts in the graph.  In
particular, if marks are made at the plotted points, and lines are
drawn between points, the lines effectively erase the marks where they
intersect.  Moreover, if lines or points overlap, they erase each
other. In the future we hope to replace this mechanism with one that
treats marks on the screen as graphical objects.
