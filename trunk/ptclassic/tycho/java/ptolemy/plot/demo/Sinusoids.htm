<h1>Plot data generated in Java</h1>

The plot below shows a collection
of sinusoids plotted with each sample explicitly shown with a
vertical line.
Like the <a href="FourierSeries.htm">Fourier series demo</a>,
this one uses Java code to compute the data on the fly.

<p> The <a href="PlotDemo.java">source code</a> defines a class <code>PlotDemo</code> 
  derived from <code>Plot</code>. This class contains a sequence of Java statements 
  in its <code>init()</code> method that configures and constructs the plot. This 
  particular example also demonstrates a number of features. In particular, the 
  X and Y ranges are given explicitly in the Java code, but note that the Y (vertical) 
  range is insufficient to contain all the points. The lines are clipped at the 
  boundary of the range. Clicking on the "fill" button at the upper right brings 
  all data within range. Note further that the Y axis is labeled with explicitly 
  given tick marks, this time placed at non-integer positions, and again given 
  string labels. Notice also that the "impulses" or &quot;stems&quot; feature 
  is turned on, causing a line to drawn from each plotted point down to the x 
  axis. This is sometimes called a &quot;stem plot;&quot; it provides an alternative 
  way to explicitly show each sample being plotted (vs. marks as in the <A HREF="Marks.htm">marks 
  demo</A>).
