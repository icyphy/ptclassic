#### YesNoCancel
# Query the user for a yes/no/cancel response to a question. The
# command to execute in response to the user's answer can be specified
# using the options "-yescommand", "-nocommand", and "-cancelcommand".
# The value returned by whichever command is executed can be obtained
# by creating the dialog box using the procedure newModal rather than
# directly creating an instance.  The value returned by the cancel button
# is -1, while yes is 1 and no is 0.
