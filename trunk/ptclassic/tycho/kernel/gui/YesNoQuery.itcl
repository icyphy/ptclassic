#### askuser

# This is done by opening a modal dialog box ("modal" means that nothing
# further happens in this thread of control until this dialog box is
# dismissed).

#### YesNoQuery
# Query the user for a yes/no response to a question. The command to
# execute in response to the user's answer can be specified using the
# options "yescommand" and "nocommand". The value returned by whichever
# command is executed can be obtained by creating the dialog box using
# the procedure newModal rather than directly creating an instance.
# This functionality can be accessed more simply through the procedure
# "::tycho::askuser".
