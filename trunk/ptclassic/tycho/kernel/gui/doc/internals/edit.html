<h1><a name="Edit class">The Edit and EditText Classes</a></h1>
<p>
The Edit class, derived from <a href=file.html>File</a>,
is a top-level window that contains
an <a name=emacs>emacs-like</a> editor with
emacs-like <a href="../bindings.html">key bindings</a>.
It has full capabilities for editing text,
saving files, etc.  The <a href="../usersGuides/EditHelp.html">help window</a>
gives additional information.
<p>
You may create an instance of the Edit class as follows:
<tcl><pre>
::tycho::Edit .e
.e centerOnScreen
</pre></tcl>
To read a file into the text widget, try
<tcl><pre>
.e insertFile
</pre></tcl>
There are many public methods associated with this class.
See the class documentation for details.

<h2>EditText Class</h2>
<p>
The top-level Edit class window
is implemented by packing into it a megawidget that implements
the editor itself.
This megawidget, the EditText class, can be used
stand-alone inside any other widget or window.
For example, the
<a href="dialogclasses.html#EntryQuery class">EntryQuery class</a>
uses EditText for multi-line entries.
<p>
Classes derived from Edit should similarly be divided into a top-level
window class and a megawidget.  This gives maximum flexibility for
using the classes in unanticipated ways.
The convention is that text editing widgets have the suffix "Text"
appended to the name of the corresponding top-level window class.
Thus, EditText is the widget used in the Edit class.
Similarly, HTMLText is a widget used in the <a href=html.html>HTML class</a>.
<p>
We can create an instance of the EditText megawidget in its own top-level
window as follows:
<tcl><pre>
::tycho::TopLevel .t
::tycho::EditText .t.t
pack .t.t
.t centerOnScreen
</pre></tcl>
Notice that you can enter text into the text window.
If you are an emacs user, you will find the keystrokes used
for navigating through the text familiar.
To delete the above example:
<tcl><pre>
delete object .t
</pre></tcl>
EditText has a number of options.  For example:
<tcl><pre>
::tycho::TopLevel .p
::tycho::EditText .p.t &#92
    -text "Initial text in the text widget" &#92
    -readonly "yes" &#92
    -width 60 &#92
    -scrollbar 0 &#92
    -height 20
pack .p.t
.p centerOnScreen
</pre></tcl>
Notice that because of the -readonly option, you cannot modify
the text.  You can change this, and read in a file as follows:
<tcl><pre>
.p.t configure -readonly no
.p.t readFile $ptolemy/tycho/kernel/Color.tcl
</pre></tcl>
There are a large number of other public methods for EditText.
See the class documentation.
To delete the above example:
<tcl><pre>
delete object .p
</pre></tcl>
