<p>
The base class for all Tycho windows that have associated with them
persistent data stored in the file system is the File class, which
is derived from <a href="view.html">View</a>.
See the <a href="../usersGuides/FileHelp.html">User's Guide</a>
for a description
of the user interface it provides.
Here we explain how to use the class in scripts.
<p>
To create an instance of the File class directly,
do the following:
<tcl quiet><pre>
set file [::tycho::view File]
</pre></tcl>
You can now pack other items into its childsite frame.
For example:
<tcl><pre>
button $file.b1 -text pushme -command "::tycho::inform thanks"
pack $file.b1
</pre></tcl>
However, this class is not intended to be used this way.
It is intended to be used instead as a base class for any top-level window
that has persistent data associated with it.
It provide some of the common functionality shared by all Tycho text editors,
for example.
In the base class, many of the commands in the menu and key bindings
do nothing useful.  They often just issue an error message.
For example, it does not make sense to save to a file, because
the File class itself has no persistent data.
<p>
The File class accepts the following options:
<dl>
<dt><a name="file option"><CODE>-file</CODE></a> <CODE><i>name</i></CODE>
<dd>This associates a file name with the File object and adjusts the
label in the window header.

<dt><a name="readonly option"><CODE>-readonly</CODE></a> 
<CODE><i>bool</i></CODE>
<dd>This specifies whether or not the file object accepts commands
to modify its data.  In the base class, the only action is to handle
the annotation at the bottom of the window that indicates whether the
file has been modified.
The <CODE><I>bool</I></CODE> value can be
<CODE>yes</CODE>, <CODE>no</CODE>, <CODE>true</CODE>,<CODE>false</CODE>,
<CODE>1</CODE>, or <CODE>0</CODE> (it is not case sensitive).

<dt><a name="autosaveinterval option"><CODE>-autosaveinterval <i>value</i></CODE></a>
<dd>The value
is the time (in minutes) between saves.  In this base class,
there is no meaningful save operation, so the
<a name="autosave">autosave</a> operation
does not do anything.  In derived classes, if the data has been
modified, then the auto-save operation will create a file called
<CODE>#auto#<I>name</I></CODE>, where <CODE><I>name</I></CODE>
is the associated file name.  This file
is automatically deleted when a successful save occurs.
