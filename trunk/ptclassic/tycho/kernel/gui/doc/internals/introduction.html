This
<a name="interactive documents">
interactive section of the Tycho documentation
</a>
will walk you through the basic class hierarchy
central to the Tycho system.  These classes are designed to be used in
your applications, and of course are used extensively in Tycho itself.
<p>
<a name="Tcl within HTML">
If you are viewing this document from within Tycho, then you can
double click on sections of Tcl code to execute them.
</a>
If you are viewing it from Netscape or some other browser, then
you cannot execute them.
Within Tycho, you should proceed sequentially through each section.
If you do not follow the commands sequentially, you will occasionally
get error messages like <CODE>Invalid command name .z.</CODE> This
just means that the command you clicked on expected a window named
<CODE>.z</CODE> to be open, and it isn't.  Back up to where the window
was first created, and create it again.  Please send email to
tycho@eecs.berkeley.edu if you find problems.

To be able to execute the embedded Tcl code, you must be viewing
this document from within tycho.  See
<a href="../../../doc/running.html">Running Tycho</a>.

<h2><a name="namespace">The "tycho" Namespace</a></h2>
In the tycho system,
all classes and most procedures are defined in a 
<a name="tycho namespace">namespace called <CODE>tycho</CODE></a>.
Such commands can be executed from any
namespace by prefixing the command with <CODE>::tycho::</CODE>.
Namespaces are a concept introduced by the Itcl extension to Tcl.
As the name implies, they provide separable collections of names
for procedures and variables, with the intention of isolating
applications and program modules that share a common infrastructure.
Thus, when referencing Tycho classes, methods, or procedures,
you should use a fully qualified name starting with the prefix
<CODE>::tycho::</CODE>.
