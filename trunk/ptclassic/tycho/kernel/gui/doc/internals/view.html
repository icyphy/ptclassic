<h1><a name="View class">The View and Displayer Classes</a></h1>
<p>
Tycho's View and Displayer classes act in concert to present a
window to the user containing graphics and text editors, and other
kinds of display. A Displayer is a top-level window; a View is a
widget that can be placed into a Displayer. Displayer is used as-is;
View is an abstract class that is subclassed in order to provide
appropriate functionality. Displayers can contain
more than one View; some Views can themselves contain other Views.

<p><b>Note:</b> Although the Displayer-View architecture is
designed to support multiple views of data within the one
top-level window, this functionality is not yet used anywhere
within Tycho. The rest of this description will only place a single
view into each displayer.

<H2>Views</H2>
<P>The <A NAME="view proc"><CODE>::tycho::view</CODE></A>
proc is a shortcut procedure to open a Displayer/View combination.
 <P>The following command will create a Displayer that contains
a View with a Edit widget inside it.
<tcl><pre>
set myview [::tycho::view Edit]
</pre></tcl>
To close the Displayer, use
<tcl><pre>
delete object [$myview displayer]
</pre></tcl>
See the <A HREF="../codeDoc/Displayer_rel.html">view</A> documentation
for further information.

<H2>Displayers</H2>
<p>Creating a new Displayer is the same as creating any other
widget:
<tcl><pre>
set myDisplayer [::tycho::autoName .myDisplayer]
::tycho::Displayer $myDisplayer
$myDisplayer centerOnScreen
</pre></tcl>

You will see an empty displayer containing a
<a href="decorators.html#StatusBar class">status bar</a>.
A view is created as a child of the displayer; for example,
we can create a text editor and place it into its displayer:
<tcl quiet><pre>
::tycho::Edit $myDisplayer.e
$myDisplayer attachView $myDisplayer.e
$myDisplayer showView $myDisplayer.e
</pre></tcl>

The Edit widget has placed itself into the Displayer and
configured its menubar. To better illustrate this, we'll
just use an empty View. First delete the Edit view:
<tcl><pre>
$myDisplayer destroyView $myDisplayer.e
</pre></tcl>


<p>Finally, deleting a Displayer and the Views contained
in it is the same as deleting any other widget:
<tcl><pre>
delete object $myDisplayer
</pre></tcl>
