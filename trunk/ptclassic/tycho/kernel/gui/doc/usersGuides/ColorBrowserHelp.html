The Tycho color browser is a simple widget designed to help you select
colors.  It presents a list of color names that Tycho knows how
to render. You can easily scroll through the list of colors.
Here is a summary of helpful hints:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Clicking on an item will display the color.
<li><CODE>Tab</CODE> is used for
<a name="index item completion">item completion</a>.
<li>Repeated <CODE>Tab</CODE>s will scroll through matching items.
<li>Up and down arrows plus the emacs-like equivalent bindings
can be used to navigate through the list of index items (if you
are using name completion, use these to navigate through the list
of possible completions).
<li>The window can be resized to see more of the items
(use whatever mechanisms your window manager provides).
</ul>
The item completion mechanism supports wildcards.  Thus, for
example, entering "*red*" and typing <CODE>Tab</CODE> repeatedly will scroll
through all the colors that have the symbolic name "red" within
their name, such as "indianred", "orangered", etc.
The color browser is a list browser
that has been specialized for browsing through lists of colors.
