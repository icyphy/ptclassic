The Tycho color browser is a simple widget designed to help you select
colors.  It presents a list of color names that Tycho knows how
to render. You can easily scroll through the list of colors.
Here is a summary of helpful hints:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Clicking on an item will display the color.
<li><CODE>Tab</CODE> is used for
<a name="index item completion">item completion</a>.
<li>Repeated <CODE>Tab</CODE>s will scroll through matching items.
<li>Up and down arrows paging shortcuts
can be used to navigate through the list of index items.
<li>The window can be resized to see more of the items
(use whatever mechanisms your window manager provides).
</ul>
The item completion mechanism supports wildcards.  Thus, for
example, entering <CODE>*red*</CODE> and typing
<CODE>Tab</CODE> repeatedly will scroll
through all the colors that have the symbolic name <CODE>red</CODE> within
their name, such as <CODE>indianred</CODE>, <CODE>orangered</CODE>, etc.
The color browser is a list browser
that has been specialized for browsing through lists of colors.
See the <a href="ListBrowserHelp.html">list browser documentation</a>.
