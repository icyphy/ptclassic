<p>
The Edit class in Tycho provides an emacs-like text editor window.
It is derived from the <a href=FileHelp.html>File class</a>, and
therefore inherits all of its features.
Several classes derived from Edit provide specialized editors for a variety
of uses.  All of these share the same emacs-like
<a href="../../../doc/bindings.html">key bindings</a> for moving
the insertion cursor, modifying text, and paging through a document.
Equivalent commands are also available in the pull-down menus
at the top.
<p>
The Edit class provides the following special features:
<ul>
<li><em><a name="Find/Change">Find/Change</a>
<a name="search">search</a></em>.  This is a fairly sophisticated search
mechanism that includes facilities for identifying only whole words,
considering case, using regular expressions, and changing all instances
at once.  When a search is launched, all matches are highlighted in the
text.  You can then step through the matches one by one by repeating the
search.
<li><em><a name="spelling checker">Spelling checker</a></em>.
The spelling checker current uses the Unix "spell" command and highlights
all whole words that the spell command identified as being misspelled.
In specialized editors derived from this one, a subset of the text
may be checked for spelling errors.  For example, in a language-specific
programming editor, only comments will be checked.  In the HTML editor,
HTML directives are ignored.
<li><em><a name="filling text">Fill</a></em>.  In the "Format" menu, three
commands support filling text. 
The <em><a name="Fill Region">Fill Region</a></em>
command restructures the selected text to make all lines approximately
the same length.  The <em><a name="Right Fill Column">Right Fill Column</a></em>
command queries the user for the maximum line length to use in filling.
The <em><a name="Set Fill Prefix">Set Fill Prefix</a></em> command queries
the user for a prefix (such as a comment character) to use when filling
text.  In language-specific derived classes, this prefix is set by
default to the comment character(s) for the language.
<li><em><a name="printing text">Printing</a></em>.  In the "File" menu,
the Print command can be used to print the entire contents of the text
widget or, if there is a selection, the selected area.
The user is prompted for the command to use for printing.
</ul>
