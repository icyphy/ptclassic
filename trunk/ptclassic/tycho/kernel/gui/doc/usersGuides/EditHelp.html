<p>
The Edit class in Tycho provides an Emacs-like text editor window.
It is derived from the <a href="FileHelp.html">File class</a>, and
therefore inherits all of its features.
Several classes derived from Edit provide specialized editors for a variety
of uses.  All of these share the same Emacs-like
<a href="../../../doc/bindings.html">key bindings</a> for moving
the insertion cursor, modifying text, and paging through a document.
Equivalent commands are also available in the pull-down menus
at the top.
<p>
The Edit class provides the following special features:
<ul>
<li><code><a name="Find/Change">Find/Change</a>
<a name="search">search</a></code>.  This is a fairly sophisticated search
mechanism that includes facilities for identifying only whole words,
considering case, using regular expressions, and changing all instances
at once.  When a search is launched, all matches are highlighted in the
text.  You can then step through the matches one by one by repeating the
search.

<li><code><a name="spelling checker">Spelling checker</a></code>.  The
spelling checker current uses the Unix <CODE>spell</CODE> command and
highlights all whole words that the spell command identified as being
misspelled.  In specialized editors derived from this one, a subset of
the text may be checked for spelling errors.  For example, in a
language-specific programming editor, only comments will be checked.
In the HTML editor, HTML directives are ignored.

<li><code><a name="filling text">Fill</a></code>.  In the
<CODE>Format</CODE> menu, three commands support filling text.  The
<code><a name="Fill Region">Fill Region</a></code> command
restructures the selected text to make all lines approximately the
same length.  The <code><a name="Right Fill Column">Right Fill
Column</a></code> command queries the user for the maximum line length
to use in filling.  The <code><a name="Set Fill Prefix">Set Fill
Prefix</a></code> command queries the user for a prefix (such as a
comment character) to use when filling text.  In language-specific
derived classes, this prefix is set by default to the comment
character(s) for the language.

<li><code><a name="printing text">Print</a></code>.  In the
<CODE>File</CODE> menu, the <CODE>Print</CODE> command can be used to
print the entire contents of the text widget or, if there is a
selection, the selected area.  The user is prompted for the command to
use for printing.

</ul>
