<h1><a name="Exec Dialog">User's Guide to the Exec/Monitor Dialog</a></h1>

<p>The Exec Class in Tycho provides a mechanism for programmers to
execute a process. The graphical Monitor Class inherits from Exec to
provide a graphical dialog window that can execute a process in a user
specified directory and display the results.

<P>Currently the Exec/Monitor Dialog uses non-blocking I/O, which is
not supported under Windows.  The Exec/Monitor Dialog also will not
work under the Macintosh.  Consult the Tcl <CODE>open</CODE> man page
for more information.
