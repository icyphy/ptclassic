<h1><a name="file browser">User's Guide to the Tycho File Browser</a></h1>
<p>
The file browser is used for
<a name="opening files">opening any Tycho file</a>.
The file browser can be opened from most Tycho windows through pull-down
menus or by typing the key sequence <CODE>Control-x Control-f</CODE>
(In the Tycho documentation, we use the shorthand <CODE>C-x C-f</CODE>). 
Although the Tycho file browser is designed to be relatively
familiar to most users, it has some unique features.
Here is a summary of helpful hints:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Double clicking on a file name will select it and open it.
<li><CODE>Tab</CODE> is used for
<a name="file name completion">file name completion</a>.
<li>Repeated <CODE>Tab</CODE>s will scroll through matching file names.
<li>Up and down arrows plus the emacs-like equivalent bindings
can be used to navigate through the list of file names (if you
are using file completion, use these to navigate through the list
of possible completions).
<li>The window can be resized to see more of the file names
(use whatever mechanisms your window manager provides).
<li>The name entered into the entry box can be
relative to the current directory displayed by the file browser
or absolute.
</ul>
<p>
Most of the features of the file browser are exactly those of
any <a href="ListBrowserHelp.html">list browser</a> in Tycho.
The differences are:
<ul>
<li>If the user-selected item is a file, then the file is opened.
In the most common use of the file browser, the file is opened
using an editor that depends on the extension of the file name.
However, this can be modified in extensions to Tycho.
<li>If the user-selected is a directory, then the directory is read
and its contents are listed in the list box.
<li>The file browser also has a button for creating a new directory.
This brings up another dialog into which the user types the
new directory name.
</ul>
