<h1><a name="File class user's guide">User's Guide to the Tycho File Class</a></h1>
<p>
The File class in Tycho is the base class for most editors.
It provides a top-level window with a menu bar at the top.
It also provides some common key bindings that are therefore shared
by all derived classes, and
it handles autosave and crash recovery.
By itself, this class is not very useful;
the derived classes are the ones actually used.

</ul>
<p>
<h2><a name="file access">File Access Commands</a></h2>
<p>
The following commands are available in the <CODE>File</CODE> menu as well
through <a name="bindings, file access">key bindings</a>.
<dl COMPACT>
<dt><CODE>C-x C-f</CODE><dd>open a file
<dt><CODE>C-x C-v</CODE><dd>switch to a new file in the same window
<dt><CODE>C-x i</CODE><dd>insert a file
<dt><CODE>C-x C-s</CODE><dd>save the current file
<dt><CODE>C-x C-w</CODE><dd>save to some other file name
<dt><CODE>C-x p</CODE><dd>print the contents (not yet implemented)
<dt><CODE>C-x C-r</CODE><dd>evaluate a file (only valid in some derived classes)
<dt><CODE>C-x C-q</CODE><dd>toggle read-only (possibly invoking version control)
<dt><CODE>C-x v</CODE><dd>invoke revision control
<dt><CODE>C-x k</CODE><dd>close the window
<dt><CODE>C-x C-c</CODE><dd>exit the program
</dl>
<p>
In addition to the above, the <CODE>File</CODE> menu provides the following
command without any key binding:
<dl>
<dt><CODE>Revert</CODE>
<dd> Revert to the previously saved version of this file.
</dl>
<p>
The File class also provides the following binding with no corresponding
menu entry:
<dl>
<dt><CODE>C-x o</CODE><dd>move the <a name="focus">focus</a> to another window
</dl>
<h3>Version Control</h3>
<p>
The <a name="version control">version control</a> or
<a name="revision control">revision control</a> mechanism built into
the File class interfaces to either <a name="SCCS">SCCS</a>,
a Unix "source code control system", or
<a name="RCS">RCS</a>, a public domain improvement.
When the <CODE>Revision Control</CODE> command in the <CODE>File</CODE>
menu is invoked, then if the file is already under version control
by either SCCS or RCS, a control panel will appear that permits
the user to check out the file (if it is not checked out),
check in the file (if it is checked out), examine the
version history, or unedit the file (cancel changes made since
the file was checked out).
The version history mechanism displays the comments that were
filed with checkins as well as version numbers and dates.
Double clicking on an older version will cause that version
to be displayed in a new window.
<p>
If the file is not currently under revision control,
then invoking the <CODE>Revision Control</CODE> command will query
the user about whether the file should be placed under revision
control.  The list of revision control systems presented to the
user can be set as an option, but currently includes only SCCS
and RCS, with SCCS being the default.
<p>
Revision control is also used by the
<a name="toggle read-only command"><CODE>Toggle read-only</CODE></a>
command, if the file is already under revision control.
If it is not, then the read-only permissions are simply changed
without the intervention of any revision control system.
<p>
The Tycho development group uses SCCS, and has configured
the options to follow our style.  In particular, when a file
is put under the control of SCCS, it is required to have
"ID keywords", which are strings like <CODE>&#37W&#37</CODE> and
<CODE>&#37G&#37</CODE>.
When a file is checked in, these get converted into the version number
and date.
In addition, in order to support copyright notices, <CODE>&#37Q&#37</CODE>
gets converted into the current year.
<p>
<h2><a name="Window menu">Window Menu</a></h2>
<p>
File objects have a Window menu in the menu bar.
The menu contains commands that somewhat duplicate typical window
manager functions, but are provided in order to have convenient key bindings.
It also contains commands to open new, blank editors
for any type of editor that has been registered with the File class.
In addition, all open editors that are associated with named files
are listed.  This makes it easier to find editors that may have been
buried by other windows on the screen.
Note that if the editor is open in another screen of a virtual window
manager, it will not appear when you issue the command in the Window
menu.  Also, if an editor has the name <CODE>NoName</CODE> associated with it,
it does not appear in the Window menu.  To give it a name, use SaveAs
(in the <CODE>File</CODE> menu).
<h3>Window Control Commands</h3>
<p>
A few window control menu commands and associated key bindings
are provided for convenience.
<dl>
<dt><CODE>C-x 0</CODE><dd>iconify the window
<dt><CODE>C-x 1</CODE><dd>full size
<dt><CODE>C-x 2</CODE><dd>half size
<dt><CODE>C-x 6</CODE><dd>original size
</dl>
<p>
Eventually, this list will be more complete, but in the current version,
bugs in the interface to the window manager make this impossible.
<p>
<h3><a name="registering an editor">Registering an Editor with the
File Class</a></h3>
<p>
Since Tycho is meant to be an extensible system, it is expected
that users will create new editors.  Integrating these editors into
Tycho is easy.  Just issue the following command:
<pre>
::tycho::File::registerExtensions {.foo} &#92
	{::tycho::view ::tycho::EditFoo -file {%s}} &#92
	{Foo editor} "text"
</pre>
<MENU>
<LI> 
The first argument, <CODE>{.foo}</CODE> gives zero or more filename
extensions that will cause your editor to be used in place of the
default editor.  

<LI> The second argument is a string with a <CODE>%s</CODE> embedded.
The <CODE>%s</CODE> is replaced with the file name before invoking the
command, using the Tcl <code>format</code>command to use.

<LI>If the third argument is a non-empty string, then the
command will be added to the <CODE>Window</CODE> menu of all File
objects opened in the future using the value of this description as
the menu label. This permits the user to open a new blank editor of
the given class.

<LI> If the fourth argument is supplied and non-empty, then is selects
the sub-menu of the <CODE>Window</CODE> menu into which the entry to
open a blank editor will be placed. Legal values are <CODE>text</CODE>,
<CODE>graphics</CODE>, and <CODE>tools</CODE>.
</MENU>
 With the above example, a Tycho <CODE>Open
File</CODE> command on a file called <CODE>file.foo</CODE>
will cause an view of <CODE>::tycho::EditFoo</CODE> to be created.
The syntax of the command that creates the instance will be:
<pre>
::tycho::view EditFoo .some_name -file file.foo
</pre>
The name is generated automatically.  The 
<a name="-file option"><CODE>-file</CODE> option</a> must (obviously)
be understood by the editor.  But that is the only constraint on the editor.
<p>
If a editor has a ToolBar, then the <CODE>registerExtensions</CODE>
command would look like:
<PRE>
    ::tycho::File::registerExtensions {.html .htm .htl} \
            {::tycho::view HTML -file {%s} -toolbar 1} \
            {}
</PRE>

<p>
<h2><a name="Help menu">Help Menu</a></h2>
<p>
The Help menu provides access to the on-line documentation for Tycho.
The <CODE>User's Guide</CODE> entry in the menu will bring up a user's guide
for the widget in which you invoke the command, if one exists.
The <CODE>Index</CODE> entry will bring up the master Tycho index.
<p>
<h2><a name="keyboard traversal of menus">Keyboard
Traversal of the Menus</a></h2>
<p>
The mechanism for keyboard traversal of the menus is exactly
that provided in Tk.  Thus, the following explanation is from
the Tk man pages, written by John Ousterhout.
<p>
"The menus can be invoked using the Alt key (sometimes
"Alt Graph") together with the underlined character
in the menu title.  Once the menu is posted, typing
the underlined character in a menu item will invoke it.
The F10 key will post the <CODE>File</CODE> menu.
<p>
<h2><a name="autosave">Autosave</a>
<p>
Tycho will save the data to a file with the same name as the current
file but with the prefix <CODE>#auto#</CODE>.  This file is
automatically removed when you save the modified data.
