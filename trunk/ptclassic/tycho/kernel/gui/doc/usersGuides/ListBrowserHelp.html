<h1><a name="list browser">User's Guide to the Tycho List Browsers</a></h1>
<p>
A list browser in Tycho is a window that contains a scrolled
list box from which the user can select an item.  It is used,
for example, as a <a href="FileBrowserHelp.html">file browser</a>
and an <a href="IndexBrowserHelp.html">index browser</a>.
<p>
<h2><a name="name completion">Name Completion</a></h2>
<p>
If you enter any partial name in the entry box, and
then type a <CODE>Tab</CODE>, all items
that have the partially entered name as a prefix will be selected.
If there is exactly one match, then the matching item will replace
your prefix in the entry box.  If there is more than one match, then
the matching items are selected in the list box.
You can scroll through each of the matching names using the up
and down arrow keys (or <CODE>C-p</CODE> and <CODE>C-n</CODE>) or by repeatedly
typing <CODE>Tab</CODE>.
The matching is not case sensitive.
<p>
When you type a <CODE>Tab</CODE> for name completion, the prefix you have
entered can have <a name=wildcards>wildcard</a> characters in a fashion similar
to that used by the C-shell. Your prefix must exactly match
the prefix of an item except that the
following special sequences may appear:
<dl COMPACT>
<dt><CODE>*</CODE><dd>Matches any sequence of characters in the string,
including a null string.
<dt><CODE>?</CODE><dd>Matches any single character in the string.
<dt><CODE>[chars]</CODE><dd>Matches any character in the set given by
chars.  If a sequence of the form x-y appears
in chars, then any character between x and y,
inclusive, will match.
<dt><CODE>\x</CODE><dd>Matches the single character x.
This provides a way of avoiding the special interpretation
of the characters *?[]\ in the pattern.
</dl>
<p>
To unselect items that have been selected by name completion,
type <CODE>C-\ </CODE>.
<p>
<h2>Navigation</h2>
<p>
A second unique feature is the ability to scroll through the
list of items using standard emacs-like bindings.
The relevant bindings are:
<dl COMPACT>
<dt><CODE>C-n</CODE><dd>down one item
<dt><CODE>C-p</CODE><dd>up one item
<dt><CODE>C-v</CODE><dd>forward one page
<dt><CODE>M-v</CODE><dd>backward one page
<dt><CODE>M-&lt;</CODE><dd>move to the top of the list
<dt><CODE>M-&gt;</CODE><dd>move to the bottom of the list
</dl>
<p>
The up and down arrow keys similarly move up and down one item,
while the <em>page up</em> and <em>page down</em>
keys move up and down one page.
The <em>home</em> and <em>end</em> keys move to the top and bottom of the list,
respectively.  If there is a set of items selected (e.g.
by the name completion mechanism), then the up and down arrow keys
commands scroll through the list of selected items only, just like
repeated <CODE>Tab</CODE>s.
<p>
It is also possible to scroll through the list using the mouse.
Normally, clicking button 1 on an element selects it and deselects any
other  selected item. However,
if the mouse leaves the listbox window  with  button  1
down,  the  window  scrolls away from the mouse, making
information visible that used to be off-screen  on  the
side  of  the mouse.  The scrolling continues until the
mouse re-enters the window, the button is released,  or
the end of the listbox is reached.
<p>
Similarly, mouse button 2 may be used  for  scanning.   If  it  is
pressed  and  dragged over the listbox, the contents of
the listbox drag at high speed  in  the  direction  the
mouse moves.
<p>
<h2>Selecting Items</h2>
<p>
The more familiar features of the list browser are documented here
for completeness.
The browser consists of entry box for typing names and
a list box containing a set of items.
The entry box uses standard emacs-like
<a href="../../../doc/bindings.html">key bindings</a>.
A single mouse click on an item
in the list box will place that item in the entry box.
A double click will proceed to open the item.
What this means depends on how the list browser is configured.
For example, with the file browser, it will open the selected file
or directory.
An item in the entry box can also be opened by clicking
on the OK button or typing a <CODE>Return</CODE>.
