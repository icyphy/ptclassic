<p>
The Tycho preferences manager allows you to set a number of preferences
that control fonts, layout, and colors in the Tycho user interface.
Preferences are grouped into <I>stylesheets</I>, where each stylesheet
has one or more styles that you can choose and edit.

 <P>To open the preferences manager, choose the <CODE>Style
Preferences...</CODE> entry from the <CODE>Help</CODE> menu on the
right-hand side of any Tycho main window. This brings up a window
listing the currently-loaded style sheets. Each of these has an option
menu that selects the currently-chosen style. For example, the
<CODE>Fonts</CODE> style-sheet has (at least) the styles
<CODE>Default</CODE> and <CODE>Small</CODE>. By selecting one of the
styles in the option menu, all widgets that use that stylesheet will
change to the chosen style.

 <P>To edit the values in a style, click on the edit button next to
the option menu. For example, clicking on the Edit button of the Fonts
stylesheet brings up a window that allows you to select eight
different types of font used throughout Tycho. In any style editor,
just change the option menu or check-button selections, or type into
the entry field to change the value of the preference. All changes
take effect immediately.

 <P>Tycho stores your style preferences in the <CODE>~/.Tycho</CODE>
directory. The file in that directory named <CODE>profile</CODE>
contains the styles within each stylesheet that you have chosen.
(To make your choices all revert to the default styles, delete
this file and restart Tycho.)

 <P>Your preference values are stored in the sub-directory
<CODE>styles</CODE>. For each style-sheet that you edited, Tycho
creates a file in this directory containing the preferences that you
changed. To revert all your styles to the default values, simple
delete this directory and restart Tycho.
