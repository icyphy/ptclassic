<p>
The Tycho preferences manager allows you to set a number of preferences
that control fonts, layout, and colors in the Tycho user interface.
<i>Note: The preferences manager design and the available
preferences are changing very rapidly, so we suggest you
do not spend much time setting or adjusting your own preferences
at this stage.</i>

 <P>To open the preferences manager, choose the "Preferences..."
entry from the Help menu on the right-hand side of any
Tycho shell or editor. This brings up a window with a stack
of buttons: clicking on a button brings up another window that
gives you access to a set of preferences values. To change
a preference, simply change the text in the corresponding
entry box and press the Apply button. Pressing the OK button
(or the <CODE>Return</CODE> key) applies any changed preferences and closes
the window; the Cancel button (<CODE>Escape</CODE> key)
closes the window without changing any preferences.

 <P>If the preference is a font or color, pressing the button will
bring up a modal dialog box containing a <A
HREF="FontDialogHelp.html">FontDialog</A> or <A
HREF="ColorBrowserHelp.html">ColorBrowser</A> selector, which you can use
to select a new font or color. <I>After closing the modal dialog box,
you still have to press Apply </I> to make you change take
effect. (Sorry, we're working on a fix.)

 <P>The buttons on the man preferences selection dialog have the
same effects on all open preference viewers: Apply applies all changed
preferences; OK applies all changed preferences and closes all
open preference windows; Cancel closes all open preference windows
without changing any preferences.

 <P>There is, as yet, no way of saving changed preferences. (Again,
we're working on it.) You can, however, customize your Tycho by adding
commands to your <code>~/.Tycho/tychorc.tcl</code> file. For example,
to change the font used in text windows, add this line (you can click
on the code to execute it now if you want):
<pre><tcl>
preference assign fonts textFont  {Screen 12}
</tcl></pre>

The available preferences are still evolving, so there is no
documentation available on what they are. To find out what is available,
look at the file <code>$tycho/kernel/Defaults.tcl</code>. To
make some common preference changes easier, we have provided
two files that you can source:

 <ul><li><code><tcl>source $tycho/lib/preferences/small.tcl</tcl></code> changes all fonts
to a set of "small" sizes.

 <li><code><tcl>source $tycho/lib/preferences/large.tcl</tcl></code> changes all fonts
to a set of "large" sizes.

</ul>

(There's a bug which we haven't fixed yet: the
HTML viewer font size doesn't change; new HTML viewer
windows will, however, get the correct font size.)
