<h1><a name="HTML viewer">User's Guide to the HTML Viewer</a></h1>
<p>
The HTML viewer in Tycho provides a top-level window that
displays formatted HTML.  It is based on the
<a href="../../../lib/html_library/html/help.html">HTML library</a>
written by Stephen Uhler of Sun Microsystems, which supports all the
features of HTML 2.0.
There is currently no support in Tycho for
<a name=HTTP>HTTP</a> hyperlink references, so you cannot
within Tycho directly read documents on the internet, although
this might come in the future.  If Tycho encounters a HTML reference
that it does not understand, then Tycho with ask the user if they want 
to start up <CODE>Netscape</CODE>. (The Macintosh does not support
<CODE>exec</CODE>, so this will not work on the Mac).

A <a href="../../../lib/html_library/html/sample.html">sample document</a>
illustrates the HTML tags that are supported.
<p>
The HTML viewer is derived from the <a href="FileHelp.html">File class</a>, and
therefore inherits all of its features.
In addition, it provide a pull-down menu for adjusting the sizes
of the fonts in the display plus a toolbar at the top for invoking
commonly invoked functions. The "File" menu provides the following
commands:
<dl COMPACT>
<dt><CODE>C-x C-f</CODE><dd>open a file
<dt><CODE>C-x C-v</CODE><dd>switch to viewing another HTML file
<dt><CODE>C-x s</CODE><dd>open HTML source using the
<a href="../../../editors/textedit/doc/usersGuides/EditHTMLHelp.html">
HTML editor</a>
<dt><CODE>C-x p</CODE><dd>print the contents (not yet implemented)
<dt><CODE>none</CODE><dd>reload the file from disk
<dt><CODE>C-x k</CODE><dd>close the window
<dt><CODE>C-x C-c</CODE><dd>exit the program
</dl>
<p>

The "Special" Menu includes an <CODE>Appletviewer</CODE> choice that
will bring up a <A HREF="ExecHelp.html">Exec Dialog</A> with the
command to run the <CODE>appletviewer</CODE> on the current file.
The <CODE>appletviewer</CODE> is a windowized application that displays
Java applets.
Note that not all tcl ports support the Exec Dialog, so the Appletviewer
 choice might be greyed out.

<p>
The
<a href="../../../doc/documentation.html">
Tycho documentation policy</a>
explains Tycho-specific
<a href="../../../doc/documentation.html#HTML extensions">
HTML extensions</a>
and how to write HTML
so that an index can be generated automatically by the
<a href="../../../doc/documentation.html#indexing documents">
index generator</a>.
Note that hypertext links can be to any type of file,
and based on the file name extension, Tycho will open a context-specific
editor.  Thus, you can have hypertext links to source code,
or to graphical editors.
