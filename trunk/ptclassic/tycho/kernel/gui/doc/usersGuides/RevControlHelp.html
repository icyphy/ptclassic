<p>
The RevControl class in Tycho provides a user friendly interface
for revision control for RCS and SCCS.
<p>
The Edit class provides the following features:
<ul>
<li><em>Checkin/Checkout</em>These are the most commonly used commands.
<li><em>Unedit</em>This is used to undo the file that has been checked out.
<li><em>View History</em>This will open up all of the history associated
	with the file, and provide hyperlinks to the older revisions.
<li><em>Diff Checked Files</em>The user can check the different revisions
	to compare using this command. A diff editor will pop up and
	color the differences between the files, while leaving the common
	text in default color. When View History is first invoked, by
	default, the two most current files will be checked.
<li><em>Undo Last Checkin</em>When this is invoked, the most recent check-in
	will be undo. In another word, the user will check out the most
	recent file, and delete the log from history so that he/she can
	continue editing. Beware that the combination of <em>Diff Checked 
	Files</em> followed by an <em>Undo</em> implies erasing the most 
	recent revision.
