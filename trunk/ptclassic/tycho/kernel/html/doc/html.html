<p>
The HTML class, derived from <a href="../../gui/doc/internals/file.html">File</a>,
is a top-level window that renders HTML in a text widget.
It uses the
<a href="../../../lib/html_library/html/help.html">HTML library</a>
written by Stephen Uhler of Sun Microsystems, which supports all the
features of HTML 2.0.

 <P>The HTML browser (and in fact, all Tycho file references) supports 
<a name="HTTP">HTTP</a> hyperlink references,
so you can read documents
directly on the internet from within Tycho.

 <P>A <a href="../../../lib/html_library/html/sample.html">sample document</a>
illustrates the HTML tags that are supported.

<p>
The HTML class is used for all
<a href="../../../doc/documentation.html">Tycho documentation</a>.
It supports an extension of HTML with embedded Tcl scripts.
If the user double
clicks on a script, the Tcl script is executed in the global
namespace.
<p>
You may create an instance of the HTML class as follows:
<tcl quiet><pre>
::tycho::view HTML -file $TYCHO/doc/introduction.html
</pre></tcl>
There are many public methods associated with this class.
See the class documentation for details.
<p>
HTML has a number of options.  For example:
<tcl quiet><pre>
set h [::tycho::view HTML &#92
	-textwidth 60 &#92
	-toolbar 1 &#92
	-scrollbar 0 &#92
	-textheight 20]
$h insertData "&lt;h1&gt;Initial header in the HTML widget&lt;/h1&gt;"
</pre></tcl>
When a <CODE>.html</CODE>, <CODE>.htm</CODE> or <CODE>.htl</CODE>
file is visited, then the default is to view the file with this browser.
The interaction preference sheet contains a preference that will change
this behaviour so that when one of these files is visited, then the
<a href="../../../edit/textedit/doc/usersGuides/EditHTMLHelp.html">HTML Editor</a> 
is brought up instead.
</pre></tcl>
