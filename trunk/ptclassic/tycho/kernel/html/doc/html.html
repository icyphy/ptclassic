<h1><a name="HTML class">The HTML and HTMLText Classes</a></h1>
<p>
The HTML class, derived from <a href=file.html>File</a>,
is a top-level window that renders HTML in a text widget.
It uses the
<a href="../../../lib/html_library/html/help.html">HTML library</a>
written by Stephen Uhler of Sun Microsystems, which supports all the
features of HTML 2.0.
There is currently no support in Tycho for
<a name=HTTP>HTTP</a> hyperlink references, so you cannot
within Tycho directly read documents on the internet.
A <a href="../../../lib/html_library/html/sample.html">sample document</a>
illustrates the HTML tags that are supported.
<p>
The HTML class is used for all
<a href=../../../doc/documentation.html>Tycho documentation</a>.
It supports an extension of HTML with embedded Tcl scripts.
If the user double
clicks on a script, the Tcl script is executed in the global
namespace.
<p>
You may create an instance of the HTML class as follows:
<tcl><pre>
::tycho::HTML .e -file $TYCHO/doc/introduction.html
.e centerOnScreen
</pre></tcl>
There are many public methods associated with this class.
See the class documentation for details.
<p>
<a name="HTMLText class">
<h2>HTMLText Class</h2>
<p>
The top-level HTML class window
is implemented by packing into it a megawidget that implements
the editor itself.
This megawidget, the HTMLText class, can be used
stand-alone inside any other widget or window.
For example, the Tycho welcome window contains an
instance of HTMLText.
<p>
We can create an instance of the HTMLText megawidget in its own top-level
window as follows:
<tcl><pre>
::tycho::TopLevel .t
::tycho::HTMLText .t.t -width 40 -height 10 -scrollbar 0 -html {
    &lt;h1&gt;Sample HTML Header&lt;/h1&gt;
    Sample HTML body.
}
pack .t.t
.t centerOnScreen
</pre></tcl>
To delete the above example:
<tcl><pre>
delete object .t
</pre></tcl>
HTMLText has a number of options.  For example:
<tcl><pre>
::tycho::TopLevel .p
::tycho::HTMLText .p.t &#92
    -html "&lt;h1&gt;Initial header in the HTML widget&lt;/h1&gt;" &#92
    -width 60 &#92
    -scrollbar 0 &#92
    -height 20
pack .p.t
.p centerOnScreen
</pre></tcl>
By default, an HTMLText widget is read only, so
you cannot modify its contents.
You can change this, and read in a file as follows:
<tcl><pre>
.p.t configure -readonly no
.p.t readFile $ptolemy/tycho/doc/rationale.html
</pre></tcl>
Notice that emacs-like <a href="../../../doc/bindings.html>key bindings</a>
can be used to navigate through the text.
There are a large number of other public methods for HTMLText.
See the class documentation.
To delete the above example:
<tcl><pre>
delete object .p
</pre></tcl>
