<h1>Web library help page</h1><p>
Welcome to the <b>help</b> page for the <i>alpha</i>
version of the SunLabs HTML display library, release 0.3.
The purpose of this
library is to display html, in a simple yet extensible manner.
The library comes with a very simple demo application, which is suitable
for reading this page.

For more <font size=+4><font size=+8>I</font>nformation</font>
on how to use the library, see the

you like in your documents.
