<h2>List constructs</h2>
</a>
HTML supports 5 different list constructs:
<dl COMPACT>
<b><dt>ul</b><dd>Unordered lists 
<b><dt>ol</b><dd>Ordered lists 
<b><dt>dl</b><dd>definition lists (like this)
<b><dt>menu</b><dd>menu lists
<b><dt>dir</b><dd>directory lists
</dl><p>
All of the list constructs can nest, with each successive nesting
level indented relative to the previous one.
The HTML <b>blockquote</b> element, although not technically
a list construct, nests with the other lists.
<p>
Lists have two rendering styles, <b>regular</b>
<ul>
<li>This is a regular list element
<li>So is this
</ul><p>
Which leaves a little space between the elements, and
<b>compact</b>
<ul COMPACT>
<li>This is a compact list element
<li>So is this
</ul><p>
Compact lists are a more scrunched together.
<h2> Examples of list elements</h2></p>
This is a summary of the list types:
<ul>
<li>This is an unordered list
<li>Each list element in an unordered list is preceded by a list
symbol, or marker that changes depending upon the nesting level
of the list.  As you can see, when a single list element needs to wrap
onto the next display line, it stays indented
<ul COMPACT>
	<li>This is a nested unordered list
	<li>The marker symbol changed
	<li>This list is <b>compact</b>
	<li>Notice less spacing between the list elements
</ul>
<li>Back to the outer list
<li>Its not compact
</ul>
<p>
Here is an example of an ordered list
<ol>
<li>This is item 1
<li>This is item 2
<li>You can see the list items are numbered
<ol>
	<li>When ordered lists are nested
	<li>Each nesting level gets its own numbers
</ol>
<li>This is the end of the ordered list
</ol>
<p>
The other two list styles are <b>directory</b> lists
and <b>menu</b> lists.  For now, directory lists are rendered
excactly like unordered lists, because no-one uses them.  
Menu lists are also like un-ordered lists, but the're not supposed to
nest, and they get a different list marker, like this:
<menu compact>
<li>menu item 1
<li>menu item 2
<li>menu item 3
</menu>
<h2>Mixed lists</h2>
</p>
Definition lists, ordered lists, and un-ordered lists can
be freely intermingled (<b>block quotes</b> too).  Menu lists
and directory lists can be combined with the others, but
<i>officially</i> only at the highest nesting level.
<ul>
<li>This is an un-ordered list
<li>Individual list items can have phrase markup, such as
<b>bold</b> or <i>italic</i>
<ol COMPACT>
	<li>This is a <b>compact</b> ordered list
	<li>The list items are numbered.  Inside this ordered list we could
have a <b>block quote</b> which is a nested paragraph. Notice that
blockquotes, in addition to rendering in <i>italic</i>, indent the
right margin.
	<li>From Moby Dick:
<blockquote>
Call me Ishmael.  Some years ago--never mind how
long precisely --having little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular
to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the
watery part of the world.  It is a way I have of driving off the spleen, and
regulating the circulation.
</blockquote>
	<li>Back to the list
	<ol>
		<li>Lists can be nested arbitrarily deep
		<li>Nesting levels more than about 5 or 6 probably won't do
what you expect, however.
		<li>Within nested list elements, you can include
preformatted objects, such as <i>tables</i> that observe the current
list indent setting, such as<pre>

<b>item		quantity		price
----		--------		-----</b>
  A		  27		  $4.36
  B		  19		  $2.84
  C		  11		  $22.34
</pre>
Tabs within preformatted objects each take up half of an indent level.
You can also use line breaks inside lists.
<br>- like this -<br>
or even start new paragraphs.
<p>This is a new paragraph started inside a list element.
In general, except where explicitly prohibited (or indicated
otherwise), you may nest any tag within any other tag.
	</ol>
	<li>We can also nest definition lists, like this:
	<dl>
		<dt>This is the defining term
		<dd>And this is its definition
		<dt>term 1<dt>term2
		<dd>More than one term can have the same definition
	</dl>
	<li>Currently, markup can't be used inside a definition term
of a definition list (although one can use markup out-side of it).
</ol>
<li>This is the outer-most list.  Although not indicated in the specification,
you can use lists with no <code>li</code> constructs to effect indented
paragraphs.
<ul><br>
This is text in an unordered list, but leaving off the <code>li</code>
tag.  As you can see, it looks just like an indented paragraph, a 
construct that is not defined in HTML.
</ul>
This is back to the outer-most list.
</ul>
<hr>
<a name=markup>
<h2> Phrase markup</h2>
</a><p>
HTML has many tags that affect the font style, one can use either
<i>functional</i> tags such as <strong>strong</strong> or <cite>cite</cite>,
which is the prefered method, or markup tags, such as <b>bold</b> or
<i>italic</i>.
<p>
The basic font style is a plain medium-roman font.
<ul>
<li>The Quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.
</ul>
<p>
<a name=test>target</a>
HTML defines many tags that alter the font style.  The Three
primary style alterations are:
<ul>
<li>bold:<br>
<b>The Quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.</b>
<li>italic:<br>
<i>The Quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.</i>
<li>mono-spaced font:<br>
<tt>The Quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.</tt>
</ul>
<p>
There are two additional styles that are deprecated, but still used
in some contexts.  They are
<ul>
<li>underline:<br>
<u>The Quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.</u>
<li>strike-out:<br>
<strike>The Quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.</strike>
</ul>
<p>
Font styles may be arbitrarily nested, to obtain combinations
like <b><i>bold italic</i></b> or
<u><b><tt>Underlined bold mono-spaced</u></b></tt>.
all of the combinations are enumerated somewhere else.
<p>
The <i>functional</i> tags, which map to one of more of the
combinations above are:
<menu COMPACT>
<li><cite>cite</cite> - for citations
<li><code>code</code> - for code fragments
<li><em>em</em> - for emphasis
<li><kbd>kbd</kbd> - for <i>user input</i>
<li><samp>samp</samp> - for samples
<li><strong>strong</strong>
<li><var>var</var> - for variable references
</menu>

<a name=entities>
<h2>HTML entities</h2>
</a><p>
In HTML, the characters &amp;, &lt;, &gt;, and &quot; are special, and
need to be represented as: &amp;amp;, &amp;lt;, &amp;gt;, and &amp;quot;.
<p>
n addition, the entire latin-1 character set can be represented similarly, 
such as
&amp;reg; (&reg;) or
&amp;ouml; (&ouml;).
<hr>
<a name=images>
<h2>Images</h2>
</a><p>
The library can handle any inline image type that you can coerce into 
a TK image.  Images are often used in HTML to simulate lists, as in:
<pre>
<img src=green_ball.gif> This is a good point
<img src=green_ball.gif> This is a good point too
<img src=red_ball.gif> This is a <b>bad</b> point
<img src=red_ball.gif> so is this
<img src=green_ball.gif> another good one
</pre>
<p>
Sometimes images are used for, well images.
<img src=lake.gif>
<cite>The view out the window...</cite>
<hr>
<center>
<a name=other>
<h2>Other Stuff</h2></a>
Although not in the spec, I support centering.
<h3>This is a centered heading</h3>
<img src=green_ball.gif>
<img src=green_ball.gif>
<img src=red_ball.gif>
<img src=green_ball.gif>
<img src=green_ball.gif>
<pre>
Those are centered balls.

This is some more centered stuff.
</pre>

<a name=forms>
<h2>Forms</h2></a><p>
HTML defines 3 types of user-modifyable constructs:
</menu>
<li>image maps
<li>searchable indexes
<li>forms
</menu><p>
An image map is an image defined inside a hyperlink anchor, such as:<br>
<a href=imagemap><img src=bar.gif ismap></a>
When you click on the image, it tacks the cursor position onto the
<code>href</code> value, and (hopefully), the server knows what to 
do with it.
<p>
The <code>isindex</code> tag is for simple searchable indexes.  They look
like this:<br><isindex><br>
or if you use the <code>prompt</code> parameter, like this:
<br><isindex prompt="Type stuff here, please"><br>
Like imagemaps, the text you entered is munged beyond recognition, and
tacked onto the <b>current</b> link.  You can either key <code>return</code>
or hit the <i>submit</i> button.
<p>
The
<a href=forms.html>remaining contructs</a> occur inside <code>form</code>
and <code>/form</code> tags.
