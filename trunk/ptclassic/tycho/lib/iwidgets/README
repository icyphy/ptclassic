README: $TYCHO/lib/iwidgets

This is a partial copy of the [incr Widgets] 3.0.0
release. The current latest versions from Mark Ulferts
are at $TYCHO/lib/iwidgets3.0.0. Files in this tree are
those that are actively being developed by Tycho
developers. By the time of the full 3.0.0 release,
the full set of 3.0.0 files will have migrated into
this tree.

If you need to modify a prerelease 3.0.0 widget and it
isn't in this tree, copy it from iwidgets3.0.0 and
put it under SCCS control. Please let johnr know so he
can keep the release up to date.
