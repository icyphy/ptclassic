<UL>
The minimum indent for each level of the tree. This option is needed
in order that each level is indented correctly, regardless of the
presence or not of open-close buttons at each level. It sets the
minimum indent, not the actual indent: if either <B>-closedbitmap</B>
or <B>-openedbitmap</B> makes an open-close button wider than the
specified indent, that width will be used instead. (There is no
reasonable way to avoid this, since that's how Tk's grid manager
works.) The default value is 24 pixels.

</pre><H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>
<P>
The <B>widgettree</B> command creates an unfolding tree of widgets,
with a button at each node to open and close the node. The widget is
designed for implementing unfolding preference and dialog boxes as
well as viewers of tree-like structures.
<P>
Each item in the tree is referenced by a unique id, which is constructed
in the same manner as hierarchical Tk widget names, but without
the leading period. For example, a node at the top level may
have the id &lt;code&gt;foo&lt;/code&gt;, and a widget contained within that
node the id &lt;code&gt;foo.bar&lt;/code&gt;. Widgets and nodes are added to
the tree with the <B>add</B> method.
<P>
Widgets can be added to the tree either when the Widgettree is
created or as each node is opened. To add widgets as node are opened,
supply the <B>-createcommand</B> option. This command will be
evaluated when a node with no children is opened -- it should
call <B>add</B> to add children to the node.

</pre><H2>TREE TRAVERSAL</H2>

If the <B>-traversal</B> option is true, the widget tree can be
navigated using tab traversal and cursor keys. Each button will accept
the focus, and can be traversed using the standard Tk traversal
mechanism. The Return key opens or closes the node with the focus. In
addition, cursor keys navigate the tree as follows:
<DL>
<DT> <B>down</B>
</I></B>
<DD> Move to the next button in the same node. If at the bottom,
stay there.
</DL>
<DL>
<DT> <B>up</B>
</I></B>
<DD> Move to the previous button in the same node. If at the top,
stay there.
</DL>
<DL>
<DT> <B>left</B>
</I></B>
<DD> Move up to the parent node, if there is one. If there
isn't, stay there.
</DL>
<DL>
<DT> <B>right</B>
</I></B>
<DD> If the node is closed, open it. If there are child nodes,
move to the first child. If there aren't any, stay there.
</DL>
<P>
Widgettree does not implement a selection mechanism, but does provides
some support for it with the <B>locate</B> method. If required,
selection can be implemented by wrapping or subclassing Widgettree.

</pre><H2>METHODS</H2>
<P>
The <B>widgettree</B> command creates a new Tcl command whose
name is <I>pathName</I></B></I>.  This
command may be used to invoke various
operations on the widget.  It has the following general form:
<pre>
<I>pathName</I> option </B></I>?<I>arg arg ...</I>?
</pre>
<I>Option</I> and the <I>arg</I>s
determine the exact behavior of the command.  The following
commands are possible for widgettree widgets:

</pre><H2>WIDGET-SPECIFIC METHODS</H2>
<DL>
<DT> <I>pathName</I> <B>add</B> <I>type</I> <I>id</I> ?<I>arg</I> ...?
</I></B>
<DD> 
Add a new widget to the tree. The first argument is the widget type,
and the second is its unique id. Raise an error if an item with
<I>id</I> already exists. IDs are hierarchical, as in
&lt;code&gt;foo.bar&lt;/code&gt; -- the parent node must already exist
(&lt;code&gt;foo&lt;/code&gt;, in this case). The special type <B>node</B> is used
to create a new node, in which case options are passed directly to the
constructor of the node label, which is a Tk label. Usually, the
options will include at least the <B>-text</B> option.
<UL>
Any other value of <I>type</I> is assumed to be the type of the widget to 
create.  The optional arguments comprise an option-value list which can 
contain any valid options for <I>type</I>.  By default, the widget's options 
are integrated into the mega-widgets option-list with the <B>usual</B> 
option handling, which will cause the following   option-handling
commands to be used:
</UL>
</DL>
<pre>
    keep -font -background -cursor -disabledforeground -foreground \
    	-highlightthickness -highlightcolor
	rename -labelfont -font font Font
</pre>
To override this behaviour, the <I>optioncmds</I> argument 
can be appended to the option list.  This is in the same form as the second 
argument to the <B>itk_component add</B> method of <B>itk::Archetype</B>.  
For example, we could add an entry widget to the tree and rename its 
background to a new option called <B>-entrybackground</B>:
<pre>
  $widgettree add entry {
      usual
      rename -background -entrybackground entryBackground Background
  }
</pre>
<DL>
<DT> <I>pathName</I> <B>cget</B> <I>option</I>
</I></B>
<DD> 
Returns the current value of the configuration option given by
<I>option</I>.  <I>Option</I> may have any of the values accepted by the
<B>widgettree</B> command.
</DL>
<DL>
<DT> <I>pathName</I> <B> close</B>  <I>nodeid</I>
</I></B>
<DD> 
Close a node of the tree. If the node is already closed, this method
does nothing. If the <B>-closecommand</B> option is not null, append
the id and evaluate the command in the global scope. In this case,
the node is not closed -- the close command must explicitly close it
with the <B>hide</B> method. If the <B>-closecommand</B> option is null,
the node is just closed.  Raise an error if the node does not exist or
if <I>nodeid</I> is a leaf.
</DL>
<DL>
<DT> <I>pathName</I></B></I> <B>configure</B> ?<I>option</I>? ?<I>value option value ...</I>?
</I></B>
<DD> 
Query or modify the configuration options of the widget.  If no
<I>option</I> is specified, returns a list describing all of the
available options for <I>pathName</I></B></I> (see <B>Tk_ConfigureInfo</B> for
information on the format of this list).  If <I>option</I> is specified
with no <I>value</I>, then the command returns a list describing the
one named option (this list will be identical to the corresponding
sublist of the value returned if no <I>option</I> is specified).  If
one or more <I>option-value</I> pairs are specified, then the command
modifies the given widget option(s) to have the given value(s); in
this case the command returns an empty string.  <I>Option</I> may have
any of the values accepted by the <B>widgettree</B> command.
</DL>
<DL>
<DT> <I>pathName</I> <B>delete</B> <I>id</I>
</I></B>
<DD> 
Delete an item from the tree. If the item is a node, then all
descendents are deleted too. Raise an error if the item does not
exist. Note that the grid rows occupied by the item are not reclaimed,
but this should not be visible.
</DL>
<DL>
<DT> <I>pathName</I> <B>disable</B> <I>nodeid</I>
</I></B>
<DD> 
Disable a node. Raise an error if the node does not
exist or <I>nodeid</I> is not a node.  The open-close button is disabled,
and the label foreground changed to the value given by the 
<B>-disabledforeground</B> option.
</DL>
<DL>
<DT> <I>pathName</I> <B>enable</B> <I>nodeid</I>
</I></B>
<DD> 
Enable a node. Raise an error if the node does not
exist or <I>nodeid</I> is not a node.  The open-close button is enabled,
and the label foreground changed to the value given by the 
<B>-foreground</B> option.
</DL>
<DL>
<DT> <I>pathName</I> <B>hide</B> <I>nodeid</I>
</I></B>
<DD> 
Unconditionally close a node of the tree, without checking the
<B>-closecommand</B> option. If the node is already closed, this method
does nothing. Raise an error if the node does not exist or if
<I>nodeid</I> is a leaf.
</DL>
<DL>
<DT> <I>pathName</I> <B>itemcget</B> <I>id</I> <I>option</I>
</I></B>
<DD> 
Return a configuration option of an item. Raise an error if the item
does not exist or if the option is invalid. Legal options are exactly
those described for the <B>add</B> method.
</DL>
<DL>
<DT> <I>pathName</I> <B>itemconfigure</B> <I>id</I> ?<I>option</I>? ?<I>arg</I> ...?
</I></B>
<DD> 
Configure options of an item. If only <I>id</I> is supplied, return
the list of options of that item. If <I>option</I> is supplied, return
that option. If additional arguments are supplied, configure each
option with the given value. Raise an error if the item does not exist
or an invalid option is supplied. Legal options are exactly those
described for the <B>add</B> method.
</DL>
<DL>
<DT> <I>pathName</I> <B>locate</B> <I>x</I> <I>y</I> ?<I>id</I>?
</I></B>
<DD> 
Return the id of the item at the given <I>x</I> and <I>y</I>
coordinates. If the <I>id</I> argument is given, it must be a node,
and the <I>x</I> and <I>y</I> coordinates are relative to the interior
of that node. If <I>x</I> is negative, then the <I>x</I> coordinate is
ignored in figuring out which item is under the mouse -- this is most
useful when drag-selecting a region of the tree. If <I>x</I> is
non-negative, then an id is returned only if the mouse is actually
over an item.
</DL>
<DL>
<DT> <I>pathName</I> <B>names</B> ?<I>nodeid</I>?
</I></B>
<DD> 
Return the ids of children of a node. If the
<I>nodeid</I> argument is not supplied, return the list of items at the
top level of the tree. If <I>nodeid</I> is supplied, it must be a node or
an error is raised. The result in this case will be a list of children
of that item.
</DL>
<DL>
<DT> <I>pathName</I> <B>open</B> <I>nodeid</I>
</I></B>
<DD> 
Open a node of the tree. If the node is already open, do nothing. If
the node has no children and <B>-createcommand</B> is not null, append
the id and evaluate at the global scope. If the node has children and
<B>-opencommand</B> is not null, append the id and evaluate at the
global scope. Raise an error if the node does not exist or if
<I>nodeid</I> is not a node.
</DL>
<DL>
<DT> <I>pathName</I> <B>toggle</B> <I>nodeid</I>
</I></B>
<DD> 
Toggle the state of a node of the tree: if the node is open, close it;
if it is closed, open it. The effects of this operation are as described
for the <B>open</B> and <B>close</B> methods.
</DL>
<DL>
<DT> <I>pathName</I> <B>traverse</B> <I>mode</I> ?<I>nodeid</I>?
</I></B>
<DD> 
Traverse the tree. This method is provided because Tk's default Tab
traversal doesn't give the user enough control over where the
traversal goes. The <I>mode</I> controls the traversal operation, while
the <I>nodeid</I> is the id of the button that currently has the
focus. If <I>nodeid</I> is null or not supplied, then no button has the
focus. To aid construction of call-backs, the <I>nodeid</I> can either be
a node id or a widget path. <I>mode</I> is case-insensitive, and can be one
of <B>down</B>, <B>return</B>, <B>up</B>, <B>left</B>, or <B>right</B>,
with the effect described for the default bindings. It can also be
<B>to</B>, which moves the focus to the given node.  If the
<B>-traversal</B> option is false, the method returns without doing
anything.
</DL>
<DL>
<DT> <I>pathName</I> <B>type</B> <I>id</I>
</I></B>
<DD> 
Return the type of <I>id</I>. The type will be value of the <I>type</I>
argument passed to the <B>add</B> method when the item was created.
Raise an error if the item does not exist.
