# This makefile is an autoconf makefile, not a standard Ptolemy makefile

# This file is a makefile for the Ptk package.
# If it has the name "makefile.in"
# then it is a template for a makefile;  to generate the actual makefile,
# run "./configure", which is a configuration script generated by the
# "autoconf" program (constructs like "@foo@" will get replaced in the
# actual makefile.
