<h1>Audio I/O demonstration</h1>

Welcome to the prototype audio control panel! Sorry about the
formatting, but this will be fixed sooner or later ...

 <P>
<b>General information</b>

 <P> This application controls the Sun Audio device. By default, the
Ptolemy universe that created it configures the device to run stereo
at 44.1 kHz with 16-bit linear encoding. This is the simplest (and
most useless!) real-time audio demonstration we have -- it just
demonstrates that the audio works.

 <P>
<b>Controls</b>

<dl>

<dt>Input and output selectors

<dd>The input and output selectors do the obvious thing. Or, at least,
they would if they worked. We haven't gotten around to this
yet. Really, buttons would be nicer than check-boxes --  what do you
think?

<dt>Rec

<dd>Controls the gain on the input. For CD source, this should really
be down quite low to avoid clipping.

<dt>Bal

<dd>Controls the balance of the output signal. Negative numbers are
left, positive are right (we think...)

<dt>Gain

<dd>Controls the output gain. Again, if it's too high or there's too
much gain in a filter (in other applications), you'll get nasty
noises.  We really need an amplitude-limiting star to prevent this...

</dl>

 <P>
<b>Shortcuts</b>

<ul>
<li>Start -- Control-g
<li>Pause -- Control-p
<li>Resume -- Control-r
<li>Stop -- Control-s
<li>Close -- Control-x k
</ul>
