<h2>Tone control demonstration</h2>

Welcome to the three band ToneControl panel! The tonecontrol
demo consists of one high-pass, one band-pass and one low-pass
filter.

<P>
<b>General information</b>

 <P> As for the other audio demos, this application controls
the Sun Audio device. By default, the Ptolemy universe that created it
configures the device to run stereo at 44.1 kHz with 16-bit linear
encoding.

<P> The demo consists of one each of high, band and low-pass filters. 
There is a single control panel, with control over the band gain for each
filter. The frequency ranges for the filters can be set using the 
"edit parameters" (e) feature of Ptolemy.

<b>Controls</b>

<dl>

<dt>Input and output selectors

<dd>The input and output selectors do the obvious thing. Or, at least,
they would if they worked.

<dt>Rec

<dd>Controls the gain on the input. For CD source, this should really
be down quite low to avoid clipping.

<dt>Bal

<dd>Controls the balance of the output signal. Negative numbers are
left, positive are right.

<dt>Low

<dd>Controls the output gain of the low-pass filter. Again, If the gain
 too high or there's too much gain in the filter, you'll hear clipping.

<dt>Mid

<dd>Controls the output gain of the band-pass filter. Again, If the gain
 too high or there's too much gain in the filter, you'll hear clipping.

<dt>High

<dd>Controls the output gain of the high-pass filter. Again, If the gain
 too high or there's too much gain in the filter, you'll hear clipping.
