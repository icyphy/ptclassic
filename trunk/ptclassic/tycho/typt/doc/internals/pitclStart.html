<H1>Starting Pitcl</H1>
Pitcl is an interface to the Ptolemy kernel that is present in Ptolemy 0.7
and later.  Pitcl is not backward compatible with ptcl, it is
intended to replace ptcl.  Pitcl uses Itcl classes, ptcl does not.
 <P>The pitcl command documentation is discussed
<A HREF="pitcl.html">elsewhere</A>.  This page discusses starting Pitcl.

 <P>Below we list different ways of starting Ptolemy, and which interface
(pitcl or ptcl is present).
<DL>
<DT> <CODE>pigi</CODE>, <CODE>ptrim</CODE>, <CODE>ptiny</CODE>,
<CODE>pigi -ptrim</CODE> etc.
<DD> If you bring up a Tycho TclShell window by typing a <CODE>y</CODE> in a
VEM facet, then the TclShell will have a ptcl interpreter behind it.

<DT> <CODE>ptcl</CODE>, <CODE>ptcl.ptrim</CODE>, <CODE>ptcl.ptiny </CODE>
<DD> Start a ptcl interpreter.

<DT> <CODE>pitcl</CODE>, <CODE>pitcl.ptrim </CODE>, <CODE>pitcl.ptiny</CODE>
<DD> Start a pitcl interpreter.

<DT> <CODE>tysh</CODE>, <CODE>tysh -ptrim</CODE>, <CODE>tysh -ptiny</CODE>
<DD> Start a binary that has a pitcl interpreter.

<DT> <CODE>tycho -pigi</CODE>, <CODE>tycho -ptrim</CODE>,
<CODE>tycho -ptiny</CODE>
 <DD> Start a binary that has a pitcl interpreter.

</DL>
 <P>In Tycho, <CODE>Tycho.tcl</CODE> sets <CODE>::ptolemyfeature(pitcl)</CODE>
if pitcl is present, and <CODE>::ptolemyfeature(ptcl)</CODE> is set if ptcl is present.
