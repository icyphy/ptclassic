<h1><a name="Ptcl editor">User's Guide to the Ptcl Editor</a></h1>

<p> This class provides a text editor specialized for editing Ptcl
source.  Ptcl is the Ptolemy extension to Tcl.  
Ptolemy is a software environment that provides simulation an code
generation capabilities.
<A HREF="http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu"><CODE>http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu</CODE></A>
describes the Ptolemy project in detail.  
See the <A HREF="../../../../typt/doc/internals/pitcl.html">pitcl</A>
page for a description of pitcl, a different interface to the Ptolemy
kernel.

 <P>The Ptcl Editor is automatically
invoked whenever you open any file with an <a
name=".ptcl"><CODE>.ptcl</CODE> extension</a> or <a
name=".pt"><CODE>.pt</CODE> extension</a>.

 <P>If you are running Tycho outside of Ptolemy, and Octtools
is not present in the binary and a directory is opened
that contains a <CODE>schematic/contents;</CODE> subfile, and the
directory is not named <CODE>*.pal</CODE>, then this editor will attempt
to run <CODE>oct2ptcl</CODE> to convert the Octtools facet to ptcl and
then display the results.  If you are running Tycho with a binary
that has Octtools, then Vem will open up the Octtools facet in the usual
way.

 <P>The <a name="EditPtcl
class">EditPtcl class</a> is derived from the <a
href="EditItclHelp.html">EditItcl class</a>, and therefore inherits
all of its features.  It colors certain Ptcl constructs, such as
comments and universe definitions.

<P>To evaluate a ptcl file, you must have the ptcl extensions built
into the binary that tycho is running.  To start tycho with the ptcl
extension, run <CODE>tycho -pigi</CODE>.  See <A
HREF="../../../../doc/running.html">the Tycho startup
documentation</A> for more information.

<p>
The Ptcl editor has a <CODE>Special</CODE> menubutton, which has the 
following choices:
<MENU>

<LI> <CODE>Retarget</CODE> - Brings up the
<A HREF="../../../../typt/editors/doc/usersGuides/RetargetHelp.html">Retargetting</A>
editor, which can be used to retarget a Ptolemy universe between
domains.  The <CODE>Retarget</CODE> menu choice is disable if
the Tycho binary does not have the Ptolemy kernel built in.

<LI> <CODE>List Domains</CODE> - List the domains used by the ptcl file.

<LI> <CODE>List Stars</CODE> - List the names of the stars used by the ptcl
file. 

<LI> <CODE>Universe Name</CODE> - Show the name of the universe defined by
this file.

</MENU>
