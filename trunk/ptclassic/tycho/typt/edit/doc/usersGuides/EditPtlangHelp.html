<p>
This class provides a text editor specialized for editing
Ptlang files.
Ptlang is the preprocessor language used to define Ptolemy stars.
Its editor is invoked automatically when opening any file with a
<a name=".pl extension"><CODE>.pl</CODE> extension</a> 
in its name.
The <a name="EditPtlang class">EditPtlang class</a> is derived from the
<a href="EditCppHelp.html">EditCpp class</a>, the C++ editor, and
therefore inherits all of its features.
At the moment, it does little more than color Ptlang keywords.
