Retargetting Editor</a></h1>

<p>

This class provides a graphical editor that can be used to retarget
Ptolemy universes.

<P> Ptolemy is a software environment that provides simulation an code
generation capabilities.  <A
HREF="http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu">http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu</A>
describes the Ptolemy project in detail, but briefly, a Ptolemy
program is called a <I>Universe</I> which consists of multiple
functional blocks, (such as adders etc.) named <I>Stars</I>.
Different models of computation are called Ptolemy <I>Domains</I>.
This editor is used to retarget Universes between different domains.
For example, there is the CG56 domain that generates code for the
Motorola 56k processor and there is a domain for the Texas Instruments
C50 domain.  This editor can be used to retarget a universe that was
written in the CG56 domain to the C50 domain.  The retargetting editor
can also be used to compare the stars in two different domains.

editor tutorial</a></h2>

The Retargetting editor can be started up from a <A HREF="../../../../editors/textedit/doc/usersGuides/EditPtclHelp.html">ptcl editor</A>.

The <CODE>Special</CODE> menu button in the ptcl editor contains the
<CODE>Retarget</CODE> menu choice which brings up the retargetting editor.

<H3>Retargetting Buttons</H3>
<MENU>
<LI> Compare Domains: This button compares the stars in the two current domains and displays the different categories of conflict.

<LI> Change Domain A: This button brings up a entry widget that prompt the
user for the name of the domain.  Usually domain A is the domain we are
retargetting from.

<LI> Change Domain B: This button brings up a entry widget that prompt the
user for the name of the domain.  Usually domain B is the domain we are
retargetting to.

<LI> Check Universe: This button asks the ptcl editor for a list of
all the stars in it and then checks the stars against the different
types of conflicts.

</MENU>

The bottom of the retargetting window contains a serious of counters
that display the number of stars in the different categories.  If you
move the mouse over these counters, then the status window should
provide a brief description of the counter.

<H3>A short example</H3>

<OL>
<LI> Start up <CODE>tycho -pigi</CODE>.  The <CODE>-pigi</CODE> option
means that tycho uses a binary that knows about the Ptolemy stars.

<LI> Open the file
<A HREF="$PTOLEMY/tycho/typt/lib/PtolemyFacets.fst"><CODE>$PTOLEMY/tycho/typt/lib/PtolemyFacets.fst</CODE></A>.
<CODE>PtolemyFacets.fst</CODE> contains a forest that describes all
the different universes in the Ptolemy tree.  A graphical window that
displays the forest should come up.

<LI> Scroll the forest window until the <A
HREF="$PTOLEMY/src/domains/cgc/demo/sound"><CODE>$PTOLEMY/src/domains/cgc/demo/sound</CODE></A>
node is visible and then double click on the node. A ptcl editor
window should come up that contains a textual description of the
<I>sound</I> universe.

<LI>  Under the <CODE>Special</CODE> menu button in the ptcl editor, select
the <CODE>Retarget</CODE> choice, the retarget editor should come up.

<LI> In the Retargetting editor, mouse on the <CODE>Change Domain A</CODE>
button and change the domain to CGC

<LI> In the Retargetting editor, mouse on the <CODE>Check Universe</CODE>
button.  After a brief wait, the Retargetting editor will display the
names of the stars in sound demo, and the conflicts between the CGC and the
C50 domain.  You can double click on a star name which will bring up a window
that compares the two stars in the different domains.

<LI> To compare all the stars in the CGC and C50 domains, mouse on the 
<CODE>Compare Domains</CODE> button.
</OL>



<h2><a name="Ptolemy Retargetting editor bugs">Ptolemy Retargetting
editor bugs</a></h2>

<menu>

<li> Currently, while the tool is comparing domains, no status messages
come up until after the compare is done. Perhaps we need an update or a
flush here.

<li> If the user opens the retargetting editor from a ptcl editor, we should
probably change domainA to the domain of the universe in the ptcl editor.

<li> The buttons that change domainA and domainB should be menus with radio
button choices of all the domains.  Also, the buttons don't get updated
with the name of the new domain choice.

<li> If the user is attempting to retarget a multi domain universe,
then things could get a little confusing. Currently, the tool throws
away the domain information of the stars in the ptcl file and just
compares star names.
