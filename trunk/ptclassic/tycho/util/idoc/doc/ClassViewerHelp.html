<h1><a name="IDoc Viewer">User's Guide to the IDoc Viewer</a></h1>
This class allows browsing of 
<a href = "../../../../kernel/doc/codeDoc/Class.idoc">::tycho::Class models</a>.
One day it may replace HTML as the documentation viewer of choice for Tycho.
<p>

The Viewer consists of three widgets, one 
<a href = "../../../../kernel/doc/codeDoc/MultiPanel.idoc">MultiPanel</a> 
widget, and two 
<a href = "../../../../kernel/doc/codeDoc/HTML.idoc">HTML</a> widgets. The 
MultiPanel allows the user to select only those items she is interested in, and 
then bring more detailed information into the HTML widgets. The upper HTML
widget contains toplevel information about the particular class at all times, 
while the lower HTML widget contains the specific information requested by the
user. The MultiPanel also allows a quick scan of the items in it by passing the
mouse pointer over relevant text.
<p>

The relative sizes of the constituent widgets of the IDoc are flexible. When
passing the mouse pointer over the interior borders of the widgets, it changes
into an arrow indicating which way the border may be dragged. Users may also
specify a preference for a particular size by using the Tycho
<a href = "../../../../kernel/gui/doc/usersGuides/PreferencesHelp.html>Preferences
Manager</a>.
<p>

The IDoc Viewer is part of the IDoc system, which is described in more detail in
a paper available in
<a href = "http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cliffc/project/report.pdf">PDF</a>
as well as 
<a href = "http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cliffc/project/report.ps">PostScript&#174;</a>
formats.
<p>

In brief, the IDoc system consists of the
<a href = "../../../../kernel/doc/codeDoc/Class.idoc">Class model</a>, which 
encapsulates relevant class information across programming language boundaries; 
the <a href = "../codeDoc/IDocSys.idoc">documentation generator</a>, currently
available in 
<a href = "../codeDoc/ItclDocSys.idoc">Itcl</a> and
<a href = "../codeDoc/JavaDocSys.idoc">Java</a> flavors, which generates the 
Class models; and the IDoc Viewer, which understands how to display models 
according to their languages.
