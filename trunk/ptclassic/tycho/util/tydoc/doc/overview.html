Tydoc is the Tycho documentation system.  Tycho consists of two main parts:
<DL>
	<LI> <DT>DocSys classes<DD>The tydoc itcl classes <CODE>DocSys</CODE>, 
	<CODE>DocClass</CODE>, <CODE>ListDocSys</CODE> and 
	<CODE>HTMLDocSys</CODE>.  These classes are defined in 
	<A HREF="../DocSys.itcl"><CODE>$TYCHO/lib/tydoc/DocSys.itcl</CODE></A>
	These classes could be used inside tycho for direct runtime
	conversion of itcl files to html.
	
	<LI> <DT><CODE>tydoc</CODE><DD>A small standalone binary that
	takes file names as command line arguments and converts the
	files to html output.  For example <CODE>tydoc
	DocSys.html</CODE> would convert DocSys.html into four files,
	one for each class in the <CODE>doc/codeDoc</CODE> directory.
	If the <CODE>doc/codeDoc</CODE> directory does not exist, 
	it is created.	
</DL>

<H2>How it works</H2>
	
Tydoc reads in an itcl file, protects the contents of the comments
from interpretation, and then parses the file as a list into lists of
different elements.
	
<P> To produce output in different formats, we have all of the format
specific information in the child class.  Currently, we only generate
HTML output, but we have written test code that merely regenerates the
itcl file as text, operating as a pretty printer. That code is at
<A HREF="../TextDocSys.itcl"><CODE>TextDocSys.itcl</CODE></A> in the
tydoc directory.

<H2>File formatting conventions</H2>
Note: this should be merged into a Tycho style guide.

<P> Tydoc depends on certain formatting conventions to grab comment
information.
<H3>Comment formatting</H3>

In tcl, a comment line is a line that has a <CODE>#</CODE> as the
first non-blank character.  The symbol <CODE>#</CODE> is usually
referred to as a hashmark, a poundsign or an octothorpe.  In this
document we refer to <CODE>#</CODE> as a hashmark.

<MENU>

	<LI> Lines that contain more than one hashmarks are not copied
	into the tydoc output.

	<LI> A <I>docComment</I> is a block of comments associated
	with a itcl construct.  An itcl construct is a part of the
	language like a class or method declaration.  For a block of
	comments to be associated with a construct, there must be
	no blank lines between the block of comments and the construct.
